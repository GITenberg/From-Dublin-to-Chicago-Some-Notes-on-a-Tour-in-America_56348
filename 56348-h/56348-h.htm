<div><h1>CHAPTER I<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE SPIRIT OF ADVENTURE</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>"From Dublin to Chicago." You can
take the phrase as the epitome of a tragedy,
the long, slow, century and a half old tragedy
of the flight of the Irish people from their
own country, the flight of the younger men
and women of our race from the land of their
birth to the "Oilean Úr," the new island of
promise and hope across the Atlantic. Much
might be written very feelingly about that
exodus. The first part of it began in reality
long ago, in the middle of the 18th century,
when the farmers of north-east Ulster were
making their struggle for conditions of life
which were economically possible. When the
land war of those days was being waged and
<span class='pageno' title='10' id='Page_10'></span>
the fighters on the one side were called
"Hearts of Steel," that war which resulted in
the establishment of the once famous Ulster
Custom, hopeless men fled with their families
from Belfast, from Derry, and from many
smaller northern ports. They settled in America
and avenged their wrongs in the course of
the War of Independence. For the rest of
Ireland the great exodus began later. Not
until the middle of the 19th century when the
famine of 1846 and the following years
showed unmistakably that the social order of
Connaught and Munster was impossible. It
continued, that exodus, all through the years
of the later land war. It is still going on,
though the stream is feebler to-day. I could
write a good deal about this exodus, could
tell of forsaken cottages, of sorrowful departures,
of broken hearts left behind. But
it was not in the spirit of tragedy that we made
our expedition to America, from Dublin to
Chicago.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The phrase has another connotation. It carries
with it a sense of adventuring. It was
<span class='pageno' title='11' id='Page_11'></span>
often, almost always, the bravest and most adventurous
of our people who went. It was
those who feared their fate too much who
stayed at home. There is something fascinating
in all the records of adventuring. We
think of Vasco da Gama pushing his way
along an unknown coast till he rounded the
Cape of Good Hope. We think of Columbus
sailing after the setting sun, and our hearts
are lifted up. Less daring, but surely hardly
less romantic, were the goings forth of our
Irish boys and girls. They went to seek sustenance,
fortune, life at its fullest and freest
in an unknown land in unguessed ways. I
like to think of the hope and courage of those
who went. They had songs—in the earlier
days of the adventuring—one seldom hears
them now—which express the spirit of their
going. I remember taking a long drive,
twenty years ago, through a summer night
with a young farmer who for the most part
was tongue-tied and silent enough. But the
twilight of that June evening moved him beyond
<span class='pageno' title='12' id='Page_12'></span>
his self-restraint and he sang to me with
immense emotion:</p>

<p class='pindent'>"To the West! to the West! To the Land
of the Free!" I was vaguely uncomfortable
then, not understanding what was in his heart.
I know a little better now. He was a man with
a home, settled and safe, with a moderate
comfort secured to him, but the spirit of adventuring
was in his blood, and America represented
to him in some vague way the Hy
Brasil, the Isles of the Blest, which had long
ago captivated the imagination of his ancestors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, we went adventuring, too; but compared
to theirs our adventure was very tame,
very unworthy. Our ship was swift and safe,
or nearly safe. It seemed hardly worth while
to make our wills before we started. There
were waiting for us on the other side friends
who would guide our steps and guard us from—there
were no dangers—all avoidable discomfort.
We even had a friend, such is our astounding
good fortune, who offered to go with
us and actually did meet us in New York. He
<span class='pageno' title='13' id='Page_13'></span>
had spent much time in America and was well
accustomed to the ways of that country. We
were dining in his company, I remember, in
the familiar comfort of a London club, when
the news that we were really to go to America
first came to us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>"I'd better go, too," he said, "you'll want
some one to take care of you. I don't think
that either one or other of you is to be trusted
to the American newspaper reporters without
an experienced friend at your elbows."</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next time we dined in our friend's company
it was in the restaurant of the Ritz Carlton in
New York, and very glad we were to see him,
though the newspaper reporter in America is
by no means the dangerous wild beast he is
supposed to be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was thus little enough of real adventuring
about our journey to America. Yet to
us it was a strange and wonderful thing. We
felt as Charles Kingsley did when he wrote
"At Last," for a visit to America had long
been a dream with us. There are other places
in the world to which we wanted and still want
<span class='pageno' title='14' id='Page_14'></span>
to go. Egypt is one of them, for we desire to
see the deserts where St. Antony fasted and
prayed. The South Pacific Archipelago is
another, for we are lovers of Stevenson; but
for me, at least, the United States came first.
I wanted to see them more than I wanted to
see the Nitrian Desert or Samoa. It was not
Niagara that laid hold on my imagination, or
the Mississippi, though I did want to see it
because of "Huckleberry Finn." What I desired
most was to meet American people in
their own native land, to see for myself what
they had made of their continent, to understand,
if I could, how they felt and thought, to
hear what they talked about, to experience their
way of living. I wanted to see Irish friends
whom I had known as boys and girls. I had
been intimate with many of them before they
went out. I had seen them, changed almost beyond
recognition, when they returned, on rare
short visits to their homes. I wanted to know
what they were doing out there, to see with my
own eyes what it was which made new men and
women of them. I wanted to know why some
<span class='pageno' title='15' id='Page_15'></span>
of them succeeded and grew rich, why others,
not inferior according to our Irish judgment,
came back beaten and disillusioned to settle
down again into the old ways. Neither Egypt
nor Samoa, not India, not Jerusalem itself,
promised so much to me as America did.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is besides a certain practical advantage,
in our particular case, which America has
over any other country to which we could
travel. The Americans speak English. This
is a small matter, no doubt, to good linguists,
but we are both of us singularly stupid about
foreign tongues. My French, for instance, is
despicable. It is good enough for use in Italy.
It serves all practical purposes in Spain and
Portugal, but it is a very poor means of conveying
my thoughts in France. For some
reason the French people have great difficulty
in understanding it, and their version of the
language is almost incomprehensible to me,
though I can carry on long conversations with
people of any other nation when they speak
French. It is the same with my Italian, my
German and my Portuguese. They are none
<span class='pageno' title='16' id='Page_16'></span>
of them much good to me in the countries to
which they are supposed to belong. This is
a severe handicap when traveling. We both
hate the feeling that we are mere tourists. We
do not like to be confined to hotels with polyglot
head waiters in them, or to be afraid to
stir out of the channels buoyed out with Cook's
interpreters. We see sights, indeed, visit picture
galleries, cathedrals, gape at mountains
and waterfalls; but we never penetrate into the
inside of the life of these foreign countries.
We are never able to philosophize pleasantly
about the way in which people live in them.
The best we can do is to wander after nightfall
along the side streets of cities, or to rub shoulders
with the shopping crowd during the afternoon
in Naples or Lisbon. America is foreign
enough. It is as foreign as any European
country, as foreign as any country in the world
in which people wear ordinary clothes. I dare
say Algiers is more foreign. I am sure that
Borneo must be. But New York is just as
strange a place as Paris or Rome and therefore
just as interesting, with this advantage for us
<span class='pageno' title='17' id='Page_17'></span>
that we could understand, after a few days,
every word that was spoken round us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Indeed this similarity of language was something
of a disappointment to us. We did not
actually expect to hear people say "I guess"
at the beginning of every sentence. We knew
that was as impossible as the frequent "Begorras"
with which we Irish are credited. But
we had read several delightful American
books, one called "Rules of the Game" with
particular attention, and we thought the
American language would be more vigorously
picturesque than it turns out to be. The
American in books uses phrases and employs
metaphors which are a continual joy. His conversation
is a series of stimulating shocks. In
real life he does not keep up to that level.
He talks very much as an Englishman does.
There are, indeed, ways of pronouncing certain
words which are strange and very pleasant.
I would give a good deal to be able to say
"very" and "America" as these words are said
across the Atlantic. "Vurry" does not represent
the sound, nor does "Amurrica," but I
<span class='pageno' title='18' id='Page_18'></span>
have tried in vain to pick up that vowel. I
suppose I am tone deaf. I either caricature it
as "vurry" or relapse into the lean English
version of the word. There are also some
familiar words which are used in ways strange
to me. "Through," for instance, is a word
which I am thoroughly accustomed to, and
"cereal" is one which I often come across in
books dealing with agriculture. But I was
puzzled one morning when an attentive American
parlor maid, with her eye on my porridge
plate, asked me whether I was "through with
the cereal." Solicitors on this side of the Atlantic
are regarded as more or less respectable
members of society. Some of their clients may
consider them crafty, but no one would class
them, as actors used to be classed, with vagabonds.
It was therefore a surprise to me to
read a notice on an office door: "Solicitors
and beggars are forbidden to enter this building."
I made enquiries about what the solicitors
had done to deserve this, and found that
"solicitor," in that part of America, perhaps
all over America, means, not a kind of lawyer,
<span class='pageno' title='19' id='Page_19'></span>
but one who solicits subscriptions, either for
some charity or for his own use and benefit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are other words, "Baggage check,"
for instance, which could not be familiar to
us, because we have not got the thing to which
they belong in the British Isles. And a highly
picturesque vigorous phrase meets one now
and then. There was an occasion in which a
laundry annoyed us very much. It did not
bring back some clothes which had gone to be
washed. We complained to a pleasant and
highly vital young lady who controlled all the
telephones in our hotel. She took our side in
the dispute at once, seized the nearest receiver,
and promised to "lay out that laundry right
now." We went up to our rooms comforted
with the vision of a whole staff of washer
women lying in rows like corpses, with napkins
tied under their chins, and white sheets over
them. Americans ought not to swear, and do,
in fact, swear much less than English people
in ordinary conversation. The Englishman,
when things go wrong with him, is almost
forced to say "Damn" in order to express his
<span class='pageno' title='20' id='Page_20'></span>
feelings. His way of speaking his native language
offers him no alternative. The American
has at command a small battery of phrases
far more helpful than any oath. It is no temptation
to damn a laundry when you can "lay
it out" by telephone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I like the American use of the word "right"
in such phrases as "right here," "right now,"
and "right away." When you are told, by
telephone, as you are told almost everything in
America, that your luggage will be sent up to
your room in the hotel "right now," you are
conscious of the friendliness of intention in the
hall porter, which the English phrase "at once"
wholly fails to convey. Even if you have to
wait several hours before you actually get the
luggage you know that every effort is being
made to meet your wishes. You may perhaps
have got into a bath and find yourself, for the
want of clean clothes, forced to decide between
staying there, going straight to bed, and getting
back into the dirty garments in which you
have traveled. But you have no business to
complain. The "right now" ought to comfort
<span class='pageno' title='21' id='Page_21'></span>
you. Especially when it is repeated cheerily,
while you stand dripping and embarrassed at
the receiver to make a final appeal. The word
"right" in these phrases does not intensify, it
modifies, the immediateness of the now. This
is one of the things to which you must get
accustomed in America. But it is a friendly
phrase, offering and inviting brotherliness of
the most desirable kind. That it means no more
than the "Anon, sir, anon," of Shakespeare's
tapster is not the fault of anybody. Some
sacrifices must be made for the sake of friendliness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But taken as a whole the American language
is very little different from English. I imagine
the tendency to diverge has been checked
by the growing frequency of intercourse between
the two countries. So many Americans
come to England and so many English go to
America that the languages are being reduced
to one dead level. What used to be called
"Americanisms" are current in common talk
on this side of the Atlantic and on the other
there is a regrettable tendency to drop even the
<span class='pageno' title='22' id='Page_22'></span>
fine old forms which the English themselves
lost long ago. "Gotten" still survives in
America instead of the degraded "got," but I
am afraid it is losing its hold. "Wheel" is in
all ways preferable to bicycle, and may perhaps
become naturalized here. I cannot imagine
that the Americans will be so foolish as to
give it up. Whether "an automobile ride" is
preferable to "a drive in a motor" I do not
know. They both strike me as vile phrases,
and it is difficult to choose between them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>America, as a country to travel in, had for
us another attraction besides its language.
Some people have relations in Spain to whom
they can go and in whose houses they can stay
as guests. Others have relatives of the same
convenient kind in Austria and even in Russia.
Many people have friends in France and Germany.
We are not so fortunate. When we
go to those countries we spend our time in
hotels, or at best in pensions. We do not discover
intimate things about the people there.
It is impossible for us to learn, except through
books, and they seldom tell us the things we
<span class='pageno' title='23' id='Page_23'></span>
want to know, whether the Austrians are morose
or cheerful at breakfast time, and whether
the Germans when at home hate fresh air as
bitterly as they hate it when traveling. And
these are just the sort of things which it is
most interesting to know about any people.
The politics of a foreign country are more
easily studied in the pages of periodicals like
"The Nineteenth Century" than in the daily
press of the country itself. Statistics about
trade and population can be read up in books
devoted to the purpose. All sorts of other information
are supplied by the invaluable Baedeker,
so that it is in no way necessary to go to
Venice in order to find out things about St.
Mark's. But very intimate details about the
insides of houses, domestic manners and so
forth can only be obtained by staying in private
homes. This we thought we might accomplish
in America because we had some friends
there before we started. In reality ready made
friends are unnecessary for the traveler in
America. He makes them as he goes along,
for the Americans are an amazingly sociable
<span class='pageno' title='24' id='Page_24'></span>
people and hospitable beyond all other nations.
To us Irish—and we are supposed to be hospitable—the
stranger is a stranger until he is
shown in some way to be a friend. In America
he is regarded as a friend unless he makes
himself objectionable, unless he makes himself
very objectionable indeed. We heard of
American hospitality before we started. We
feel now, as the Queen of Sheba felt after her
visit to King Solomon, that the half was not
told us. To be treated hospitably is always delightful.
It is doubly so when the hospitality
enables the fortunate guest to learn something
of a kind of life which is not his own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For all these reasons—I have enumerated
four, I think—we desired greatly to go to
America; and there was still another thing
which attracted us. You cannot go to America
except by sea. Even if you are seasick—and I
occasionally am, a little—traveling in a steamer
is greatly to be preferred to traveling in a
train. A good steamer is clean. The best
train covers you with smuts. The noise of the
train is nerve-shattering. The noise which a
<span class='pageno' title='25' id='Page_25'></span>
steamer makes, even in a gale, is soothing.
When a train stops and when it starts again it
jerks and bumps. It also runs over things
called points and then it bumps more. A
steamer stops far seldomer than a train, and
does so very gently and smoothly. It never
actually bumps, and though it very often rolls
or pitches, it does these things in a dignified
way with due deliberation. We chose a slow
steamer for our voyage out and if we are fortunate
enough to go to America again we shall
choose another slow steamer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having made up our minds to go—or rather
since these things are really decided for us and
we are never the masters of our movements—having
been shepherded by Destiny into a trip
to America we naturally sought for information
about that country. We got a great deal
more than we actually sought. Everyone we
met gave us advice and told us what to expect.
Advice is always contradictory, and the only
wise thing to do is to take none of what is
offered. But it puzzled us to find that the accounts
we got of the country were equally contradictory.
<span class='pageno' title='26' id='Page_26'></span>
English people, using a curious
phrase of which they seem to be very fond,
prophesied for us "the time of our lives." They
said that we should enjoy ourselves from the
day we landed in New York until the day when
we sank exhausted by too much joy, a day
which some of them placed a fortnight off,
some three weeks, all of them underestimating,
as it turned out, our capacity for enduring delight.
Americans on the other hand decried the
country, and told us that the lot of the traveler
in it was very far from being pleasant. This
puzzled us. A very modest and retiring people
might be expected to underestimate the attractions
of their own land. We Irish, for instance,
always assert that it rains three days out
of every four in Ireland. But the Americans
are not popularly supposed to be, and in fact
are not, particularly modest. I can only suppose
that the Americans we met before we
started were in bad tempers because they were
for one reason or another obliged to stay in
England, and that they belittled their country
<span class='pageno' title='27' id='Page_27'></span>
in the spirit of the fox who said the grapes
were sour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One piece of advice which we got gave us,
incidentally and accidentally, our first glimpse
at one of the peculiarities of the American
people, their hatred of letter writing as a means
of communication. The advice was this:</p>

<p class='pindent'>"Do not attempt to take a sealskin coat into
America, because there is a law there against
sealskin coats and the Custom House officers
will hold up the garment."</p>

<p class='pindent'>This seemed to us very improbable. I remembered
the song I have already quoted
about the "Land of the Free" and could not
bring myself to believe that a great nation, a
nation that had fought an expensive war in
order to set its slaves at liberty, could possibly
want to interfere with the wearing apparel of
a casual stranger. The Law, which is very
great and majestic everywhere, is, according
to the proverb, indifferent to very small matters.
America, which is as great and majestic
as any law, could not possibly be supposed to
concern itself with the material of a woman's
<span class='pageno' title='28' id='Page_28'></span>
coat. So we reasoned. But the warning was
given with authority by one who knew a lady
who had tried to bring a sealskin coat into
America and failed. We thought it well to
make sure. An inquiry at the steamboat office
was useless. The clerk there declined to say
anything either good or bad about the American
Custom House regulations. I have noticed
this same kind of cautious reticence
among all Americans when the subject of customs
comes up. I imagine that the people of
ancient Crete avoided speaking about that god
of theirs who ate young girls, and for the same
reason. There is no use running risks, and
the American Custom House officer is a person
whom it is not well to offend. This is the
way with all democracies. In Russia and Germany
a man has to be careful in speaking about
the Czar or the Kaiser. In republics we shut
our mouths when a minor official is mentioned,
unless we are among tried and trusted friends.
I myself dislike respecting any one; but if respect
is exacted of me I should rather yield it
to a king with a proper crown on his head than
<span class='pageno' title='29' id='Page_29'></span>
to an ordinary man done up with brass buttons.
However, Anglo-Saxons on both sides of the
Atlantic seem to like doing obeisance to officials,
and their tastes are no affairs of mine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having failed in the steamboat office, I
wrote a letter to a high American official in
England—not the Ambassador. I did not
like to trouble him about a sealskin coat. An
English official, high, or of middling station,
would have answered me by return of post,
because he is glad of an opportunity of writing
a letter. In fact, he likes writing letters so
much that he would have sent me two answers,
the first a brief but courteous acknowledgment
of my letter and an assurance that it was receiving
attention; the second an extract from
the Act of Parliament which dealt with my
particular problem. The American official does
not like writing letters. No American does.
Rather than write a letter, an American will
pursue you, <span class='it'>viva voce</span>, over hundreds of miles
of telephone wire, or spend an hour of valuable
time in having an interview with you in some
more or less inaccessible place. Not even promotion
<span class='pageno' title='30' id='Page_30'></span>
to a high official position will cause an
American to feel kindly toward a pen. The
official to whom I wrote would, I am sure, have
told me all there is to know about the American
dislike of sealskin coats, if he could have
got me on a telephone. He could not do that,
because my name is not in the London telephone
directory. He would, although he is a
most important person and I am less than the
least, have come to me and talked face to face
if he had known where to find me; but I wrote
from a club, and the chances were five to one
at least against his finding me there. There
was nothing for it but to write a letter; but it
took him several days to make up his mind to
the effort. His answer, when he did write it,
followed me to New York, and the sealskin
coat problem had solved itself then.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I noticed, when in New York, that it takes
a posted letter much longer to get from one
street in that city to another quite near at hand
than it does in London for a letter posted in
the same way to get from Denmark Hill to
Hampstead. I connect this fact with the dislike
<span class='pageno' title='31' id='Page_31'></span>
of letter-writing which is prevalent among
Americans. But I do not know which is cause
and which is effect. It may be that the American
avoids letters because he knows that they
will go to their destination very slowly. It
may be, on the other hand, that the American
post-office has dropped into leisurely ways because
it knows that it is seldom used for business
purposes. Love letters it carries, no doubt,
for it is difficult to express tender feelings on
a telephone, and impossible to telegraph them;
but love letters are hardly ever urgent. The
"Collins" or "Hospitable Roof" communication
must be a letter and must go through the
post, but the writer and the recipient would
both be better pleased if it never arrived at
all. Business letters are different things, and
I am sure the American post-office carries comparatively
few of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I wish that some one with a taste for statistics
would make out a table of the weights of
the mail bags carried on Cunard steamers. I
am convinced, and nothing but statistics will
make me think differently, that the westward
<span class='pageno' title='32' id='Page_32'></span>
bound ships carry far more letters than those
which travel eastward. All Englishmen, except
for obvious reasons English journalists,
write letters whenever they have a decent excuse.
Americans only write letters when they
must. It was, I think, the late Charles Stewart
Parnell who observed that most letters answered
themselves if you leave them alone long
enough. This is profoundly true, although
Englishmen do not believe it. I have tried
and I know. Americans have either come
across Parnell's remark or worked out the same
truth for themselves. I applaud their wisdom,
but I was once sorry that they practice this
form of economy. If we had got an answer
to our letter before we sailed, we should have
left the coat behind us. As it was, we took
the coat with us and carried it about America,
giving ourselves indeed a good deal of trouble
and reaping very little in the way of comfort
or credit by having it. When we did get the
letter it showed us that the Americans really
do object strongly to these coats and have
made a law against them. If we had known
<span class='pageno' title='33' id='Page_33'></span>
that before starting, we should have left the
coat behind us at any cost to our feelings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We are not aggressive people, either of us,
and we always try to conform to the customs
of the country in which we are, and to respect
the feelings of the inhabitants. We cannot,
indeed, afford to do anything else. Members
of powerful, conquering nations go about the
world insisting on having their own way wherever
they are. The English, for instance, have
spread the practice of drinking tea in the afternoon
all over Europe. They make it understood
that wherever they go afternoon tea must
be obtainable. Other peoples shrug their shoulders
and give in. The Americans have insisted
that hotels shall be centrally heated and
all rooms and passages kept up to a very high
temperature. No one else wants this kind of
heat, and until the Americans took to traveling
in large numbers we were all content with fireplaces
in rooms and chilly corridors. But the
Americans are a great people, and there is
hardly a first-rate hotel left in Europe now
which has not got a system of central heating
<span class='pageno' title='34' id='Page_34'></span>
installed. The French have secured the use of
their language, or a colorable imitation of their
language, on all menu cards and bills of fare.
No self-respecting <span class='it'>maître d'hotel</span>, even if 90%
of his patrons are Americans, English and
Germans, would dare to call soup anything except
<span class='it'>potage</span> or <span class='it'>consommé</span>. I think we owe it
to the Russians that ladies can now smoke
cigarettes without reproach in all European
restaurants, though they cannot do this yet in
America because very few Russians of the
tourist classes go to America. It must be very
gratifying to belong to one of these great nations
and to be able to import a favorite custom
or a valued comfort wherever you go.
We are mere Irish. We have never conquered
any one ourselves, although we are rather good
at winning other people's battles for them.
We have not money enough to make it worth
anybody's while to consider our tastes; nor,
indeed, are we sure enough of ourselves to
insist on having our own way. There is always
at the backs of our minds the paralyzing
thought that perhaps the other people may be
<span class='pageno' title='35' id='Page_35'></span>
right and we may be wrong. We submit
rather than struggle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We like, for instance, good tea at breakfast,
strong dark brown tea, which leaves a
distinct stain on the inside of the cup out of
which we drink it. Nobody else in the world
likes this kind of tea. If we were a conquering,
domineering people, we should go about
Europe and America saying: "This which we
drink is tea. Your miserable concoction is slop
or worse." If we were rich enough and if
large numbers of us traveled, we should establish
our kind of tea as an institution. It
would be obtainable everywhere. At first it
would be called "<span class='it'>Thé à l'Irlandaise</span>" and we
should get it by asking for it. Afterwards
it would be "thé" simply, and if a traveler
wanted anything else he would have to ask for
that by some special name. But we are not
that kind of people. There are not enough of
us, and the few there are have not sufficient
money to make them worth considering. Besides,
we are never self-confident enough to assert
that our kind of tea is the true and
<span class='pageno' title='36' id='Page_36'></span>
superior kind. We are uneasily conscious that
it is rude to describe other people's favorite
beverages as "slop" even when they call ours
"poison." And there is always the doubt
whether we may not be wrong, after all. Great
peoples do not suffer from this doubt. The
American is perfectly certain that houses ought
to be centrally heated. To him there does not
seem to be any possibility of arguing about
that. He has discovered a universal truth,
and the rest of the world must learn it from
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The German is equally sure that fresh air in
a railway carriage brings death to the person
who breathes it. He is as certain about that
as he is that water wets him when it is poured
over him. There is no room for discussion.
But we Irish are differently constituted. When
any one tells us that our type of tea reduces
those who drink it to the condition of nervous
wrecks and ultimately drives them into lunatic
asylums, we wonder whether perhaps he may
not be right. It is true that we have drunk
the stuff for years and felt no bad effects; but
<span class='pageno' title='37' id='Page_37'></span>
there is always "the plaguy hundredth chance"
that the bad effects may have been there all
the time without our noticing them, and that,
though we seem sane, we may be jibbering imbeciles.
Thus it is that we never have the heart
to make any real struggle for strong tea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This same infirmity would have prevented
our dragging that coat into America if we
had found out in time that sealskin coats strike
Americans as wicked things. To us it seems
plain that seals exist mainly for the purpose
of supplying men, and especially women, with
skins; just as fathers have their place among
created things in order to supply money for
the use of their children, or steam in order
that it may make engines work. Left to ourselves,
we should accept all these as final truths
and live in the light of them. But the moment
any one assails them with a flat contradiction
we begin to doubt. The American says that
the seal, at all events the seal that has the luck
to live in Hudson Bay, ought not to be
deprived of his skin, and that men and
women must be content with their own skins,
<span class='pageno' title='38' id='Page_38'></span>
supplemented when necessary by the fleeces of
sheep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Englishman or the German would
stand up to the American.</p>

<p class='pindent'>"I will," one of them would say, "kill a Hudson
Bay seal if I like or have him killed for
me by some one else. I will wear his skin
unless you prevent me by actual force, and I
will resist your force as long as I can."</p>

<p class='pindent'>We do not adopt that attitude. We cannot,
for the spirit of defiance is not in us. When
we were assured, as we were in the end, that
the American really has strong feelings about
seals, we began to think that he might be right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>"America," so we argued, "is a much larger
country than Ireland. It is much richer. The
buildings in its cities are far higher. Who are
we that we should set up our opinions about
tea or skins or anything else against the
settled convictions of so great a people?"</p>

<p class='pindent'>Therefore, though we brought our coat into
America, we did so in no spirit of defiance.
Once we found out the truth, we concealed the
coat as much as possible, carrying it about
<span class='pageno' title='39' id='Page_39'></span>
folded up so that only the lining showed. It
was hardly ever worn, only twice, I think, the
whole time we were there. The weather, indeed,
was as a rule particularly warm for that
season of the year.
<span class='pageno' title='40' id='Page_40'></span></p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER II<br/> <span class='sub-head'>PRESSMEN AND POLITICIANS</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Our ship, after a prosperous and pleasant
voyage, steamed up the Hudson River in a
blinding downpour of rain which drove steadily
across the decks. Our clothes had been packed
up since very early in the morning, and we
declined to get soaked to the skin when there
was no chance of our being able to get dry
again for several hours. Therefore, we missed
seeing the Statue of Liberty and the Woolworth
Building. We were cowards, and we
suffered for our cowardice by losing what
little respect our American fellow travelers
may have had for us. They went out in the
rain to gaze at the Statue of Liberty and the
Woolworth Building. We saw nothing
through the cabin windows except an advertisement
of Colgate's tooth paste. The Woolworth
Building we did indeed see later on.
<span class='pageno' title='41' id='Page_41'></span>
The Statue of Liberty we never saw at all. I
could of course write eloquently about it without
having seen it. Many people do things of
this kind, but I desire to be perfectly honest.
I leave out the Statue of Liberty. I am perfectly
sure it is there; but beyond that fact I
know nothing whatever about it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We actually landed, set foot at last on the
soil of the new world, a little before 8 <span class='sc'>a.m.</span>,
which is a detestable hour of the day under
any circumstances, and particularly abominable
in a downpour of rain. If a stranger
with whom I was very slightly acquainted
were to land at that hour in Dublin, and if it
were raining as hard there as it did that morning
in New York—it never does, but it is conceivable
that it might—I should no more think
of going to meet him at the quay than I should
think of swimming out a mile or two to wave
my hand at his ship as she passed. A year
ago I should have made this confession without
the smallest shame. It would not have
occurred to me as possible that I should make
such an expedition. If a very honored guest
<span class='pageno' title='42' id='Page_42'></span>
arrived at a reasonable hour and at an accessible
place—steamboat quays are never accessible
anywhere in the world—if the day were
fine and I had nothing particular to do, I
might perhaps go to meet that guest, and I
should expect him to be surprised and gratified.
I now confess this with shame, and I
intend to reform my habits. I blush hotly
when I think of the feelings of Americans who
come to visit us. They behave very much better
than we do to strangers. There were three
people to meet us that morning when we landed
and two others arrived at the quay almost
immediately afterwards. Of the five there
was only one whom I had ever seen before, and
him no oftener than twice. Yet they were
there to shake our hands in warm welcome, to
help us in every conceivable way, to whisper
advice when advice seemed necessary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were also newspaper reporters, interviewers,
and we had our first experience of
that business as the Americans do it, in the
shed where our baggage was examined by Custom
House officers.
<span class='pageno' title='43' id='Page_43'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>"Don't," said one of my friends, "say more
than you can help about religion."</p>

<p class='pindent'>The warning seemed to me unnecessary. I
value my religion, not as much as I ought to,
but highly. Still it is not a subject which I
should voluntarily discuss at eight o'clock in
the morning in a shed with rain splashing on
the roof. The very last thing I should dream
of offering a newspaper reporter is a formal
proof of any of the articles of the Apostle's
Creed. Nor would any interviewer whom I
ever met care to listen to a sermon. I was
on the point of resenting the advice; but I
reflected in time that it was certainly meant for
my good and that the ways of the American
interviewer were strange to me. He might
want to find out whether I could say my catechism.
I thanked my friend and promised to
mention religion as little as possible. I confess
that the warning made me nervous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>"What," I whispered, "are they likely to
ask me?"</p>

<p class='pindent'>"Well, what you think of America, for one
thing. They always begin with that."
<span class='pageno' title='44' id='Page_44'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>I had been told that before I left home. I
had even been advised by an experienced traveler
to jot down, during the voyage out, all
the things I thought about America, and have
them ready on slips of paper to hand to the
interviewers when I arrived. This plan, I was
assured, would save me trouble and would give
the Americans a high opinion of my business
ability. I took the advice. I had quite a number
of excellent remarks about America ready
in my pocket when I landed. They were no
use to me. Not one single interviewer asked
me that question. Not even the one who chatted
with me in the evening of the day on which
I left for home. I do not know why I was not
asked this question. Every other stranger who
goes to America is asked it, or at all events says
he is asked it. Perhaps the Americans have
ceased to care what any stranger thinks about
them. Perhaps they were uninterested only
in my opinion. I can understand that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor was I tempted or goaded to talk about
religion. The warning which I got to avoid
that subject was wasted. No one seemed to
<span class='pageno' title='45' id='Page_45'></span>
care what I believed. I do not think I should
have startled the very youngest interviewer if
I had confided to him that I believed nothing
at all. The nearest I ever got to religion in an
interview was when I was asked what I thought
about Ulster and Home Rule. That I was
asked frequently, almost as frequently as I was
asked what I thought of Synge's "Playboy of
the Western World"; and both these seemed
to me just the sort of questions I ought to be
asked, if, indeed, I ought to be asked any
questions at all. I do not, indeed cannot, think
about Ulster and Home Rule. Nobody can.
It is one of those things, like the fourth dimension,
which baffle human thought. Just as you
hope that you have got it into a thinkable shape
it eludes you and you see it sneering at your
discomfiture from the far side of the last ditch.
But it was quite right and proper to expect
that an Irishman, especially an Irishman who
came originally from Belfast, would have
something to say about it, some thought to express
which would illuminate the morass of
that controversy. I could not complain about
<span class='pageno' title='46' id='Page_46'></span>
being asked that question. I ought to have
had something to say about Synge's play, too,
but I had not. I think it is a wonderful play,
by far the greatest piece of dramatic literature
that Ireland has produced; but I cannot
give any reasons for the faith that is in me.
Therefore, I am afraid I must have been a
most unsatisfactory subject for the interviewers.
They cannot possibly have liked me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I, on the other hand, liked them very much
indeed. I found them delightful to talk to,
and look back on the hours I spent with them
as some of the most interesting of my whole
American trip. They all, without exception,
seemed to want to be pleasant. They were the
least conceited set of people I ever came across
and generally apologized for coming to see
me. The apologies were entirely unnecessary.
Their visits were favors conferred on me.
They were strictly honorable. When, as very
often happened, I said something particularly
foolish and became conscious of the fact, I
used to ask the interviewer to whom I had said
it not to put it in print. He always promised
<span class='pageno' title='47' id='Page_47'></span>
to suppress it and he always kept his promise,
though my sillinesses must often have offered
attractive copy. Nor did any interviewer ever
misrepresent me, except when he failed to understand
what I said, and that must always
have been more my fault than his. At first I
used to be very cautious with interviewers and
made no statements of any kind without hedging.
I used to shy at topics which seemed dangerous,
and trot away as quickly as I could to
something which offered opportunity for
platitudes. I gradually came to realize that
this caution was unnecessary. I would talk
confidently now to an American interviewer
on any subject, even religion, for I know he
would not print anything which I thought
likely to get me into trouble.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I cannot understand how it is that American
interviewers have such a bad reputation
on this side of the Atlantic. They are a highly
intelligent, well-educated body of men and
women engaged in the particularly difficult
job of trying to get stupid people, like me,
or conceited people to say something interesting.
<span class='pageno' title='48' id='Page_48'></span>
They never made any attempt to pry
into my private affairs. They never asked
obviously silly questions. I have heard of
people who resorted to desperate expedients
to avoid interviewers in America. I should as
soon think of trying to avoid a good play or
any other agreeable form of entertainment.
After all, there is no entertainment so pleasant
as conversation with a clever man or
woman. I have heard of people who were deliberately
rude to interviewers and gloried in
their rudeness afterwards. That seems to me
just as grave a breach of manners as to say
insolent things to a host or hostess at a dinner
party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every now and then an interviewer, using a
very slender foundation of fact, produces
something which is brilliantly amusing. There
was one, with whom I never came into personal
contact at all, who published a version
of a conversation between Miss Maire O'Neill
and me. What we actually said to each other
was dull enough. The interviewer, by the
simple expedient of making us talk after the
<span class='pageno' title='49' id='Page_49'></span>
fashion which "Mr. Dooley" has made popular,
represented us as exceedingly interesting
and amusing people. No one but a fool would
resent being flattered after this fashion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The one thing which puzzles me about the
business is why the public wants it done. It is
pleasant enough for the hero of the occasion,
and it is only affectation to call him a victim.
The man who does the work, the interviewer,
is, I suppose, paid. He ought to be paid very
highly. But where does the public come in?
It reads the interview—we must, I think, take
it for granted that somebody reads interviews,
but it is very difficult to imagine why. The
American public, judging from the number of
interviews published, seems particularly fond
of this kind of reading. Yet, however clever
the interviewer, the thing must be dull in nine
cases out of ten.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My first interviewer, my very first, photographed
me. I told him that he was wasting
a plate, but he went on and wasted three. Why
did he do it? If I were a very beautiful
woman I could understand it, though I think
<span class='pageno' title='50' id='Page_50'></span>
it would be a mistake to photograph Venus
herself on the gangway of a steamer at eight
o'clock in the morning in a downpour of rain.
If I had been a Christian missionary who had
been tortured by Chinese, I could understand
it. Tortures might have left surprising marks
on my face or twisted my spine in an interesting
way. If I had been an apostle of physical
culture, dressed in a pair of bathing drawers
and part of a tiger skin, the photographing
would have been intelligible. But I am
none of these things. What pleasure could the
public be expected to find in the reproduction
of a picture of a common place middle-aged
man? Yet the thing was done. I can only
suppose that reading interviews and looking
at the attendant photographs has become a
habit with the American public, just as carrying
a walking stick has with the English gentleman.
A walking stick is no real use except
to a lame man. The walker does not push
himself along with it. He does not, when he
sets out from home, expect to meet any one
whom he wants to hit. It cannot be contended
<span class='pageno' title='51' id='Page_51'></span>
that the stick is ornamental or adds in any
way to the beauty of his appearance. He carries
it because he always does carry it and
would feel strange if he did not. The Americans
put up with interviews in their papers for
the same sort of reason. After all, no one,
least of all the subject, has any right to complain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Those were our two first impressions of
America, that it was a country of boundless
hospitality and a country pervaded by agreeable
newspaper men. I am told by those who
make a study of such things that the first
glance you get at a face tells you something
true and reliable about the man or woman it
belongs to, but that you get no further information
by looking at the face day after day
for months. When you come to know the man
or woman really well, and have studied his
actions and watched his private life closely for
years, you find, if you still recollect what it
was, that your first impression was right. I
knew an Englishman once who lived for ten
years in Ireland and was deeply interested in
<span class='pageno' title='52' id='Page_52'></span>
our affairs. He told me that when he had
been a week in the country he understood it,
understood us and all belonging to us thoroughly.
At the end of three months he began
to doubt whether he understood us quite as
well as he thought. After five years he was
sure he did not understand us at all. After
ten years—he was a persevering man—he began
to understand us a little, and was inclined
to think he was getting back to the exact position
he held at the end of the first week. Ten
years hence, if he and I live so long, I intend
to ask him again what he thinks about Ireland.
Then, I expect, he will tell me that he
is quite convinced that his earliest impressions
were correct. This is my justification for recording
my first impressions of America. I
hope to get to know the country much better as
years go on. I shall probably pass through
the stage of laughing at my earliest ideas, but
in the end I confidently expect to get back to
my joyous admiration for American hospitality
and my warm affection for American journalists.
<span class='pageno' title='53' id='Page_53'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Almost immediately—certainly before the
end of our second day—we arrived at the conclusion
that New York was a singularly clean
city. We are, both of us, by inclination dwellers
in country places. The noise of great towns
worries us. The sense of being closely surrounded
by large numbers of other people
annoys us. But we should no doubt get used
to these things if we were forced to dwell long
in any city. I am, however, certain that I
should always loathe the dirt of cities. The
dirt of the country, good red mud, or the slime
of wet stems of trees, does not trouble me, even
if I am covered with it. I enjoy the dirt of
quiet harbors, fish scales, dabs of tar and rust
off old anchor chains. I am happier when
these things are clinging to me than when I am
free of them. I am no fanatical worshipper
of cleanliness. I do not rank it, as the English
proverb does, among the minor divinities
of the world. But I do not like, I thoroughly
detest, the dirt of cities, that impalpable grime
which settles down visibly on face, hands, collar,
cuffs, and invisibly but sensibly on coats,
<span class='pageno' title='54' id='Page_54'></span>
hats and trousers. New York, of all the cities
I have ever been in, is freest of this grime.
You can open your bedroom window at night
in New York, and the pocket handkerchief you
leave on your dressing table will still be white
in the morning, fairly white. You can walk
about New York all day and your nose will
not be covered with smuts in the evening. I
am told that the cleanness of New York is
partly due to the fact that trains running in
and out of the city are forced by the municipal
authorities to use electricity as a motive power
and are forbidden to burn coal till they get
into the country. I am told that only a hard,
comparatively smokeless coal may be burned by
any one in the city. If these things are true,
then the City Fathers of New York ought to
be held up as a pattern to Town Councillors
and corporations all over the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a matter of fact—such is the injustice of
man—the municipal government of New York
is not very greatly admired by the rest of the
world. It is supposed to be singularly corrupt,
and my fellow countrymen are blamed
<span class='pageno' title='55' id='Page_55'></span>
for its corruptness. When an European city
feels in a pharisaical mood it says: "Thank
God I am not as other cities are, even as this
New York." European cities may be morally
cleaner. I do not know whether they are or
not. They are certainly physically much dirtier.
And from the point of view of the ordinary
citizen physical dirt is more continuously
annoying than the moral kind. If I
lived in a community whose rulers openly sold
contracts and offices, I should break out into
a violent rage once a year or so, and swear that
I would no longer pay taxes for the benefit of
minor politicians and their henchmen. All the
rest of the year I should be placid enough, for
I should forget the corruption if I escaped the
perpetual unpleasantness of dirt, city dirt. No
government, after all, is honest. The most
that can be expected from men placed in authority
is that they should not outrage public
opinion by flaunting their dishonesty. But I
cannot help feeling that men in authority,
whom after all the rest of us pay, should do
their business, and part of their business is to
<span class='pageno' title='56' id='Page_56'></span>
keep smuts away from our faces. If it is
really true that we Irish govern New York,
then men ought to give up speaking of us as
"the dirty Irish." Dirty! It appears that we
are the only people who have ever kept a city
clean. I wish we could do it at home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This Irish political corruption in New York
is a very interesting thing, and I tried hard to
arrive at some understanding of it. Tammany
was defeated while we were in New York, and
Mr. Mitchel became Mayor, promising a clean,
morally clean, administration. He also is of
Irish descent, so that there were countrymen
of ours on both sides in the struggle, and we
are, evidently, not all of us lovers of corruption.
The scene in Broadway when the defeat
of Tammany was announced surpassed anything
I have ever beheld in the way of a demonstration
of popular rejoicing, except perhaps
"Mafeking Night" in London. Huge crowds
paraded the streets. Youths with horns
marched in procession making music like that
of Edouard Strauss, but even louder. Hawkers
did an immense trade in small gongs with
<span class='pageno' title='57' id='Page_57'></span>
balls attached to them which made a noise like
cymbals. Grave-looking men wore on their
heads huge plumes of cut, wrinkled paper, like
the paper with which some people hide fireplaces
in summer time. Others had notices on
their hats which declared "We told you so,"
notices printed beforehand and equally applicable
to a victory of the other side. Sky
signs and lights of all sorts blazed above our
heads. Newspaper offices flashed election figures
on screens in front of their windows. Now
and then an explosion rose clear above the din,
and we knew that some enterprising photographer
was making a flashlight picture of the
scene.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no question about the fact that
New York was pleased with itself. The
demonstration of popular delight would have
followed very appropriately the capture of a
Bastille, some stronghold of an ancient tyranny
which held people down against their
will. The supporters of Tammany Rule were,
of course, not in Broadway that night. They
may have been sitting at home behind drawn
<span class='pageno' title='58' id='Page_58'></span>
blinds, meditating on the fickleness of men, or
perhaps on the ingratitude of democracies.
Tammany was corrupt, no doubt, but the water
supply of New York is very good, and it was
no easy matter to get water there. Also the
city is strikingly clean. But there was no question
about the general disgust with Tammany
rule. No man whom I talked to before or
after the election had a good word to say for
the organization. Only, if I were suspected
of glorying in their shame, patriotic Americans
used occasionally to remind me of Marconi
scandals at home and the English sale of
patents of nobility. And this was no real defense
of Tammany. But I was not glorying,
and Heaven forbid that I should ever hold up
European political methods as a model to any
one. All I wanted was to understand. I was
eagerly curious to know how Tammany came
to be, whence its power came. It did not satisfy
me to be told that Tammany bribed people
and sold offices, and therefore was powerful.
That is like saying that Mohammed spread his
religion by force of arms. I am sure that
<span class='pageno' title='59' id='Page_59'></span>
Tammany did bribe, and I am sure that Mohammedans
did ultimately conquer and put
pressure on the conquered to accept the Koran.
But before you can conquer you must have
soldiers, soldiers who believe of their own free
will. Before you can bribe you must have
money to bribe with. Before you can sell offices
you must have offices to sell. How did
Tammany get itself into the position of being
able to bribe?</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was always asking these questions and always
failing to get satisfying answers to them.
In the end, when I had almost given up hope,
I did get a little light of the sort I wanted.
It was after dinner one night at a private house
in New York. The ladies had left the room,
and there were five men sitting round the table.
Four of them were clever and distinguished
men, and they might have talked very satisfactorily
about things which interested them.
But with that thoughtful courtesy which is one
of the charms of American hospitality, they
allowed the fifth man, the stranger in their
midst, to guide the conversation. I asked one
<span class='pageno' title='60' id='Page_60'></span>
of my usual questions about Tammany. For
a time I got nothing but the familiar stories of
Tammany corruption given with more than the
usual detail. We had names and dates put to
scandalous achievements, and learned who had
been allowed a "rake off" on this or that financial
transaction. I heard about the alliance,
under the banner of Tammany, between the
Irish and the Jews. I reflected that other
things besides misfortune makes strange bedfellows.
Then came the illumination. One
of the men present leaned back in his chair and
laid down his cigar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>"A Tammany ward boss," he said, "has the
confidence of the people in his ward. If he
had not he would not be a ward boss."</p>

<p class='pindent'>I did not want to interrupt by asking questions,
and felt that I could guess sufficiently
nearly the functions and business of a "ward
boss" to do without an explanation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>"He wouldn't," said my friend, "win or keep
the confidence of the people unless he deserved
it more or less, unless he deserved it a good
deal, unless he really was a friend to the people.
<span class='pageno' title='61' id='Page_61'></span>
He may not be a man of much ability. He
generally isn't, but he has a good heart."</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was startling. My preconceived idea
of a Tammany boss of any kind was of a man
of considerable ability and a bad heart. I suppose
I looked surprised. The speaker qualified
his statement a little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>"A good heart, to start with. Every one in
the ward who is in any kind of difficulty or
trouble goes to the boss. Most of them are
poor ignorant people and don't know how to
manage things for themselves. There's a sick
child who ought to be got into a hospital. The
ward boss sees about it. There's a boy who
ought to be in a situation. The ward boss gets
a situation for him. There's a man who has
been badly treated by his employer—— Oh!
you know the sort of things which turn up.
They're the same with poor people all the world
over."</p>

<p class='pindent'>I did know, very well. I was also beginning
to understand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>"Then I suppose," I said, "the people vote
the way the ward boss tells them."
<span class='pageno' title='62' id='Page_62'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>"Naturally."</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, yes, naturally. What do political
rights and wrongs matter to them?</p>

<p class='pindent'>"After a while," my informant went on,
"if he manages well, he is let a little bit into
the inner ring. He gets a bit of money
dropped to him here and another bit there.
That makes a difference to him. He begins to
do himself pretty well, and he likes it."</p>

<p class='pindent'>Most men do. These "bits of money," however
they come, bring very pleasant things
with them. That is the same everywhere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>"After a while—I don't say this is exactly
what happens every time, but it's something
like this. After a while he goes uptown and
dines at one of the swagger restaurants, just
to see what it's like. He is a bit out of it at
first, but he goes again. He sees people there
and he picks up their names. They are people
with very impressive names, names he's been
hearing all his life and associating with millions
and automobiles and diamonds. It gives
him rather a pleasant feeling to find himself
sitting at the next table and hearing the voices
<span class='pageno' title='63' id='Page_63'></span>
of these men; seeing the women with their
jewels, and smelling the scent off their clothes.
You know the sort of thing."</p>

<p class='pindent'>I could guess. I have, in my time, dined at
restaurants of the kind, though not often
enough to get to know the looks of their native
millionaires.</p>

<p class='pindent'>"Then some night or other one of these men
steps across to our man's table and talks to
him. He's as friendly as the devil. He introduces
him to one or two others, and perhaps
to some women; but women don't come much
into business over here. Well, the poor fellow
is a little bit above himself, and no wonder.
He's never been anything before but just a
'Mick,' and never expected to be anything
else."</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here I had to interrupt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>"A Mick?" I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>"An Irishman. That's what we generally
call Irishmen."</p>

<p class='pindent'>They call us "Pat" on this side of the Atlantic,
and I think I prefer it, but I have no particular
<span class='pageno' title='64' id='Page_64'></span>
quarrel with "Mick." Both names are
conveniently short.</p>

<p class='pindent'>"There's nothing more than friendliness at
first. Then, perhaps a week later, there's something
said about a contract or a new loan that
is to be floated. Influence, a word in the right
quarter, comes in useful in these cases. Our
man, the man we're talking of, doesn't know
very clearly what the talk is about. He doesn't
know that he has any influence; but it rather
pleases him to feel that the other men think he
has. There is a hint dropped about a subscription
to the party funds and—well, that's
how it's done."</p>

<p class='pindent'>I grasped at ideas which flitted past me.
There always are "party funds." Politics
cannot go on without them. There always are
desirable things, whether contracts, rakes off,
appointments, or—as in our monarch-ridden
states—titles. But I wonder where the blame
for the corruption really lies, the heavy part of
the blame. Tammany Mick had a good heart
to start with and he was not a man of much
ability.
<span class='pageno' title='65' id='Page_65'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>However, these are only the speculations of
an inquisitive man. They do not matter. New
York smashed Tammany last autumn and perhaps
will keep it smashed. But a mere alliance
of anti-Tammany forces will not permanently
get the better of a well-constructed machine,
nor is enthusiasm for clean government good
in a long-distance race. An American poet
has noted as one of the characteristics of truth
that, though slain, it will rise again, and of
error that when vanquished it dies among its
worshippers. In politics it is the machine which
possesses truth's valuable powers of recuperation,
and idealism which gets counted out after
a knockdown blow. It seems as if a machine
will only go under finally in competition with
another more efficient machine, and the new,
more efficient machine is just as great a danger
to political morality as the old one was. This
is the vicious circle in which democracies go
round and round. Perhaps the truth is that
politics, like art, are non-moral in nature, that
politicians have nothing to do with right or
wrong, honesty or dishonesty.
<span class='pageno' title='66' id='Page_66'></span></p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER III<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE "HUSTLING" LEGEND</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>I walked through New York late at night,
shortly after I landed, and had for companions
an Englishman who knew the city well
and an American. The roar of the traffic had
ceased. The streets were almost deserted.
Along Fifth Avenue a few motors rushed
swiftly, bearing belated revelers to their homes.
Save for them, the city was as nearly silent as
any city ever is. We talked. It was the Englishman
who spoke first.</p>

<p class='pindent'>"New York and the sound of blasting go
together," he said. "They are inseparably connected
in my mind. New York is built on
rock out of material blasted off rock with dynamite.
This fact explains New York. It is
the characteristic thing about New York. No
other city owes its existence in the same way
to the force of explosives shattering rock."
<span class='pageno' title='67' id='Page_67'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>"New York," said the American, "is one
of the soldiers of Attila the Hun."</p>

<p class='pindent'>The night was warm. He unbuttoned his
overcoat as he spoke and flung it back from
his chest. He squared his shoulders, looked
up at the immensely lofty buildings on each
side of us, looked round at the shadow-patched
pavements, fixed his eyes finally on the lamps
of a motor which was racing toward us from
a great distance along the endless avenue.
Then he pursued his comparison.</p>

<p class='pindent'>"Attila's soldier," he said, "went through
some Roman city with his club over his shoulder.
There were round him evidences of old
civilizations which puzzled him. He gazed at
the temples, the baths, the theaters with wondering
curiosity; but he was conscious that he
could smash everything and kill every one he
saw. He was the barbarian, but he was also
the strong man. New York is like that among
the cities of the world."</p>

<p class='pindent'>I contributed a borrowed comment on
America.</p>

<p class='pindent'>"An Irishman once told me," I said, "that
<span class='pageno' title='68' id='Page_68'></span>
America isn't a country. It's a great space in
which there are the makings of a country lying
about. He might have said the same sort of
thing about New York. There are the makings
of a city scattered round."</p>

<p class='pindent'>"Chunks of blasted rock," said the Englishman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>"The Hun had a lot to learn," said the
American, "but he was the strong man. He
could smash and crush. Nobody else could."</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is a very interesting story or sketch—I
do not know how it ought to be described—by
the late "O. Henry"—which he called "The
Voice of the City." He imagines that certain
American cities speak and each of them utters
its characteristic word. Chicago says, "I will."
Philadelphia says, "I ought." New Orleans
says, "I used to." If I had "O. Henry's"
genius I should try to concentrate into phrases
the voices of the cities I know. I should like
to be able to hear distinctly what they all say
about themselves. Belfast, I am convinced,
says, "I won't." Dublin occasionally murmurs,
"It doesn't really matter." So far I
<span class='pageno' title='69' id='Page_69'></span>
seem to get, but there I am puzzled. I should
like to hear what Edinburgh says, what Paris
says, what Rome would say if something
waked her out of her dream. I should be
beaten by London, even if I had all his genius,
just as "O. Henry" was beaten by New York.
He failed to disentangle the <span class='it'>motif</span> from the
clamorous tumult of mighty chorus with which
that city assails the ear. There is a supreme
moment which comes in the Waldstein Sonata.
The listener is a-quiver with maddening
expectation. He is wrought upon with sound
until he feels that he must tear some soft thing
with his teeth. Then, at the moment when the
passion in him becomes intolerable, the great
scrap of melody thunders triumphantly over
the confusion and it is possible to breathe
again. This is just what does not happen in the
case of places like London and New York. A
Beethoven yet unborn will catch their melodies
for us some day and the sonata of great cities
will be written. Till he comes it is better to
leave the thing alone. Neither blasting nor
dynamite is the keyword. Attila's Hun with
<span class='pageno' title='70' id='Page_70'></span>
his club fails us, though he helps a little. And
there is more, a great deal more, about New
York than the confused massing of materials
on the site of what is to be a temple or a railway
station.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When I was in New York they were building
a large edifice of some kind in Broadway,
not far from Thirty-fifth Street. I used to
see the work in progress every day, and often
stopped to watch the builders for a while.
Whenever I think of New York I shall remember
the shrill scream of the air drill
which made holes in the steel girders. The
essential thing about that noise was its suggestion
of relentlessness. Perhaps New York is
of all cities the most relentless. The steel suffers
and shrieks through a long chromatic
scale of agony. New York drills a hole, pauses
to readjust its terrible force, and then drills
again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That is one aspect of New York. The
stranger cannot fail to be conscious of it. It
is brought home to him by the rush of the overhead
railway in Sixth Avenue, by the hurry
<span class='pageno' title='71' id='Page_71'></span>
of the crowds in Broadway, by the grinding
clamor of the subway trains. It is this, no
doubt, which has given rise to the theory that
New York is a city of hustle. It seems to me
a very cruel thing to say of any people that
they hustle. The word suggests a disagreeable
kind of spurious activity. The hustler is
not likely to be efficient. He makes a fine show
of doing things; but he does not, somehow, get
much done. The hustler is like a football
player who is in all parts of the field at different
times, sometimes in the forward line, sometimes
among the backs, always breathless, generally
very much in the way, and contributing
less than any one else to the winning of the
game for his side. If New York were a city
of hustlers, New York would drill no holes in
steel girders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fact is that America has, in this matter
of hustle, been grossly slandered in Europe.
I am not sure that the Americans, with a curious
perversity, have not slandered themselves,
and done as much as any one to keep the hustle
myth alive. The American understands the
<span class='pageno' title='72' id='Page_72'></span>
value of not hurrying as well as any one in the
world. He has, justly, a high opinion of himself
and declines to be a slave to a wretched
machine like a clock. I realized this leisureliness
the first time I went into a restaurant to
get something to eat. I could have smoked a
cigarette comfortably between the ordering
and the getting of what I ordered. I could
have smoked other cigarettes, calmly, as cigarettes
ought to be smoked, between each course.
American men do actually smoke in this way
during meals, and I trace the custom not to an
excessive fondness for tobacco but to the leisurely
way in which the business of eating
is gone about. And it is not in restaurants
only that this quiet disregard of time's abominable
habit of going on is evident. The New
York business man gets through his work—it
is evident that he does get through it—without
feeling it necessary to give every one the
impression that each half hour of the day is
dedicated to a separate affair and that the
entire time-table will be reduced to chaos if
<span class='pageno' title='73' id='Page_73'></span>
a single minute strays out of its proper compartment
into the next.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps it is because I am Irish that I like
this way of doing business. There is a character
in one of the late Canon Sheehan's novels
who says that there are two things which are
plenty in Ireland—water and time. There are
undoubtedly places in the world where water
is scarce, the Sahara desert for instance; but I
suspect that time is quite abundant everywhere
though some people affect to believe that it is
not. I know English business men who scowl
at you if you venture, having settled the little
affair which brought you to their office, to
make a pleasant remark about the chances of
a general election before Christmas. They
pretend that they have not time to talk about
General Elections. They do this, as Bob Sawyer
used to have himself summoned from
church, in order to keep up their reputation.
They want you to think that they are overwhelmed
with pressing things. I have always
suspected that, having got rid of their visitor,
they spend hours reading about General Elections
<span class='pageno' title='74' id='Page_74'></span>
in the daily papers. The American business
man is, apparently, never too busy to enjoy
a chat. He invites you to lunch with him
when you go to his office. He shows you the
points of interest in the neighborhood after
luncheon. He discusses the present condition
of Ireland, a subject which demands an immense
quantity of time. He settles the little
matter which brought you to his office with
three sentences and a wave of the hand. He
does not write you a letter afterwards beginning:
"In confirmation of our conversation to-day
I note that you are prepared to——" It
is, I suppose, a man's temperament which
settles which way of doing business he prefers.
It is also very largely a question of temper.
In my normal mood I prefer the American
method. There is a broad humanity about it
which appeals to me strongly. But if I have
been annoyed by anything early in the day,
broken a bootlace, for instance, or lost a collar
stud, I would rather do business in the English
way. In the one case I like to come in
contact with a fellow man, to feel that he has
<span class='pageno' title='75' id='Page_75'></span>
affections and weaknesses like my own. It is
pleasant to get to know him personally. In
the other case, thanks to the misfortunes of
the morning, I am filled with a gloomy hatred
of my kind. I want, until the mood has worn
off, to see as little as possible of any one and
to keep inevitable people at arm's length. It
is much easier to do this when the inevitable
people also want to keep me at arm's length,
and the English business man generally does.
The friendliness of the American business man
is a little trying sometimes to any one in a
bad temper. Sometimes, not always. I remember
one occasion on which I was exceptionally
cross. I forget what had happened
to me in the morning, but it was worse than
breaking a bootlace. It may have had something
to do with telephones, instruments which
generally drive me to fury. At all events,
though in a bad temper, I had to go to see a
man in his office. He was a man of extraordinarily
friendly spirit, even for an American.
I dreaded my interview, fearing that I might
say something actually rude before it was over.
<span class='pageno' title='76' id='Page_76'></span>
Nothing could have been more soothing than
my reception. This wonderful man cast a
single quick glance at me as I entered his office.
He realized my condition and got
through with the wretched necessity which had
brought me there with a rapidity and precision
which would have done credit to any Englishman.
Then he ushered me out again without
making or giving me time to make a single
remark of a miscellaneous kind. I apologized
to him afterwards. He patted me reassuringly
on the shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>"That's all right," he said. "I saw the
minute you came into the room that you were
a bit rattled."</p>

<p class='pindent'>That seems to me a splendid example of
tact. I do not suggest that all American business
men have this faculty for swift, self-sacrificing
sympathy. It must be rare, even in
New York. Does it exist at all in England?
If I called on an English merchant some
morning when the spring was in my blood and
I felt that I wanted to leap and spring like a
lamb, would he divine my mood, join hands
<span class='pageno' title='77' id='Page_77'></span>
and dance with me on his hearth rug? I doubt
it. He would not do it even if I were a hundred
times more important than I am. He
would not do it if I were chairman of a fantastically
prosperous company. Yet it must
have been just as hard for my American friend
to be austere as it would be for an Englishman
to be inanely gay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I am not a business man myself. I have
for many years practiced the art of getting
other people to manage my small affairs for
me, so perhaps I ought not to write about business
men. But an author is always on the
horns of a dilemma. He knows he ought not
to write about anything that he does not thoroughly
understand. But if he confined himself
to those subjects, he would never write
anything at all. Even if he gave himself some
latitude and allowed himself to write about
things of which he knows a little, he would
still find himself in a narrow place. His best
hope is that if he writes freely on every subject
that comes into his head he will only be
found out by a few people at a time. Sailors
<span class='pageno' title='78' id='Page_78'></span>
will find him out when he writes about the sea.
Insurance agents will laugh at his ignorance
when he writes about premiums; doctors will
be irritated when he sets down what he thinks
about measles. But the sailors will believe that
he knows a great deal about insurance and disease
in general; doctors will think him an expert
about ships, and so forth. And there are
always far fewer people in any given profession
than there are people out of it. The
writer has therefore a good hope that those
who find him out in any point in which he
touches will always be a minority. Minorities
do not matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is the consideration of this fact which
gives me courage to write about business men,
and more courage now to go on and write about
buildings. I know nothing about architecture,
but the people who do are very few, so
that the penalty of being found out will be
light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There does not seem at first glance to be any
connection between business men and architecture.
But there is a very real one. There
<span class='pageno' title='79' id='Page_79'></span>
is also a private connection of thought in my
own mind. It was from the windows of an
office, high up in one of the skyscraper buildings,
that I got my first comprehensive view of
New York. There is, generally, a certain
sameness about these bird's-eye views of cities.
The bird, and the man who gets into the position
of the bird, sees a number of spires of
churches sticking up into the sky and below
them a huddled mass of roofs. Sometimes tall
chimneys assert themselves beside the spires.
But the spires are the dominating things. The
chimneys may have every appearance of arrogance,
but one feels that they are upstarts.
The spires hold the place of a recognized aristocracy.
The bird, if he were say an eagle,
and had not the sparrow's intimate knowledge
of the life of the streets, would naturally come
to the conclusion that the worship of God is
the most potent factor in the life of the European
city. He would, perhaps, be wrong, but
he would have a good case to make for himself
when he was recounting his experiences
to the other eagles.
<span class='pageno' title='80' id='Page_80'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>"I have seen," he would say, "these vast nesting
places of men, and the spires of the
churches are far the most important things in
them. They reach up higher than anything
else, and there are great numbers of them."</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the eagle would not say that about New
York. It is not spires, nor is it factory chimneys
which stick up highest there and catch
the attention of a spectator from a height.
Office buildings are the dominant things.
Churches are kept in what many people regard
as their proper place. You can see them
if you look for them, but they are subordinate.
The same thing is true of another view
of New York, that marvelous spectacle of the
city's profile which you get in the evening from
any of the Hudson River ferry boats. The
sky line is jagged and the silhouettes are not
those of cross-crowned domes or spires, but of
large buildings dedicated to commerce.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The philosophic eagle might, reasoning as
he did before, leap to the conclusion that God
is of little importance in the city of New York;
that bank books there count for more than
<span class='pageno' title='81' id='Page_81'></span>
Bibles. I am not at all sure that he would be
right. It looks, any one who has seen New
York must admit it, as if the American who
coined the phrase, "the almighty dollar," had
really expressed the faith of his countrymen.
But I am inclined to think that he was led into
injustice by a desire to be epigrammatic. It
may be that my experience was singularly fortunate,
but I came to the conclusion that God
counts for a good deal in the life of New York
and of America generally. I do not mean that
any creed has obtained for itself national
recognition, or that any particular church has
reached a position analogous to that of the
English established church. Religion in
America seems to me a confused force, which
has not yet fully found itself; but it is a force.
The desire to do justly, to love mercy, though
scarcely perhaps to walk humbly, is present
and is coming to be mightier than the dollar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet it is certainly true that the most striking
buildings in New York are not ecclesiastical,
but commercial. This is a defiance of
the old European tradition, a breach even of
<span class='pageno' title='82' id='Page_82'></span>
that feebler tradition which America took over
from Europe before she entered into possession
of her own soul. I am reminded of Attila's
Hun with his contempt for Roman civilization
and his confidence in his own strength.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Business used to look askance at magnificence.
It was the pride of the London merchant
that he managed mighty affairs in an
unpretentious counting house. But we are
learning from the Americans. Our insurance
companies were the first to start building
sumptuous habitations for themselves. Banks
and other corporations are following their example.
Yet even to-day the offices in the city
of London are singularly unimpressive to the
eye, and many a house with world-wide influence
scorns to appeal to the passerby with
anything more striking than a "Push" or
"Pull" stamped in worn letters on the brass
plates of a pair of swinging doors. It was a
great tradition, this total lack of ostentation
where mighty forces were. At first New York
too felt the attraction of it. Wall Street,
which is one of the older parts of the city, is
<span class='pageno' title='83' id='Page_83'></span>
not impressive to look at. The Cotton Exchange
is a building of a very middling kind.
Yet I am inclined to think that the instinct for
magnificence displayed by the newer American
captains of commerce is sound. I am not
considering the advertisement value of a great
building. It may be worth something in that
way, though grubbiness can also be an effective
advertisement. What seems to lie at the
back of the display is the desire of life to express
itself in sumptuousness. The Venetians,
a nation of merchants, felt this and built in
the spirit of it. After all, commerce is a very
great kind of life. There is energy in it, adventure,
romance. It offers opportunities for
struggle, promises victory, threatens defeat.
Is it any wonder that men absorbed in it should
feel the thrill of the "<span class='it'>superbia vitæ</span>" and build
to secure visible embodiment for the emotion?
Men have always tried to build finely for their
governors. Kings' palaces and parliament
houses are impressive everywhere. This was
right when kings and parliaments were important.
Now that the offices of financiers
<span class='pageno' title='84' id='Page_84'></span>
are much more important than the habitations
of law makers, they too are becoming splendid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is, I suppose, to be expected that these
mighty buildings should have forms which at
first are repellent in their strangeness. We,
who were nursed in an older artistic tradition,
have learned to value, perhaps too highly, restraint
and dignity. The outstanding characteristics
of the American skyscraper seem
to me to be exuberance. I am reminded of the
wild spirit of one or two European buildings,
of the cloisters of Belem, for instance, though
there the sense of exultation expresses itself
in a very different way. But the essential
spirit is similar. I could imagine the builders
chanting as they worked: "Behold ye are gods.
Ye are all children of the Highest." They
are gods who have not experienced the <span class='it'>tedium
vitæ</span> of Olympian happiness. But New York
is not so drunken with exuberance that it can
not build with quiet dignity. Tiffany's shop
in Fifth Avenue, and, a little lower down, Altman's
great department store, are buildings
on which the eye rests with undisturbed satisfaction.
<span class='pageno' title='85' id='Page_85'></span>
The men who built these had more in
mind than the erection of houses in which rings
or stockings might conveniently be sold. They
felt that commerce in jewelry or clothes was
in itself a worthy thing which might be undertaken
in a lofty spirit, and greatly carried on.
There is a feeling of nobility in the proportion
of windows and doors, in the severity of
the street fronts. These might be palaces of
noblemen of an ancient lineage. They are—shops.
Has America discovered a dignity in
shop-keeping? The station of the Pennsylvania
Railway is one of the glories of New
York, and here again New York is certainly
right, though I—it is a purely personal feeling—am
infuriated to find the calm self-restraint
of the Greeks associated with anything
so blatant as a railway train. Anywhere else
in the world the great hall of the Central
Station would be the nave of a Cathedral. It
is impossible not to feel—even when hurrying
for a train—that the porters are really acolytes
masquerading for a moment in honor of some
fantastic fool's day.
<span class='pageno' title='86' id='Page_86'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The churches of New York are of subordinate
interest. Trinity Church has a singularly
suggestive position, right opposite the
end of Wall Street, God in protest against
Mammon. But the building itself might be
anywhere in England. I can fancy it in Nottingham
or Bath, and there would be no need
to alter the place of a stone in it. It is a dignified
and beautiful parish church, but it has,
as a building, nothing American about it. It
has not, apparently, influenced the spirit of
New York architecture. The people have not
found self-expression in it. St. Patrick's
Cathedral, in Fifth Avenue, is a fine, a very
fine example of modern Gothic. Except the
new Graduate College buildings at Princeton,
this cathedral strikes me as the finest example
of modern Gothic I have ever seen. But ought
New York to have Gothic buildings? Here,
I know, I come up against the difficult question.
There are those who hold that for certain
purposes—for worship and for the dignified
ceremonial life of a university—the Gothic
building is the one perfect form which man
<span class='pageno' title='87' id='Page_87'></span>
has devised. We cannot better it. All we can
do is soak ourselves in the spirit of the men of
the great centuries of this style and humbly
try to feel as they felt so that we may build
as they. It may be granted that we shall devise
nothing better. I, for one, gladly admit
that St. Patrick's in New York and the Hall
at Princeton are conceived in the old spirit and
are as perfect as any modern work of the kind
is, perhaps as perfect as any modern Gothic
work can be. But when all this is said it remains
true that the life of New York is not
the life of mediæval Rouen, of the London
which built Westminster or of the Cologne
which paid honor to the Three Kings. Can
New York accept as its vision of the divine
the conception, however splendid, of those
"dear dead days"?</p>

<p class='pindent'>It may well be that I am all wrong in my
feeling about modern Gothic, that what is
wanting in these buildings is not the spirit
which was in the old ones. It may be that, like
certain finer kinds of wine, they require maturing.
I can conceive that a church which
<span class='pageno' title='88' id='Page_88'></span>
seems remote now, almost to the point of frigidity,
may not only seem, but actually be, different
two hundred years hence. It is scarcely
possible to think that the prayers of generations
have no effect upon the walls of the
building in which they are uttered. There
must cling to the place some aroma, some
subtle essence of the reachings after God of
generation after generation. The repentances
of broken hearts, the supplications of sorrowing
women, the vows of strong, hopeful souls,
the pieties of meek priests, must be present
still among the arches and the dim places above
them. Men consecrate their temples, but it
takes them centuries to do it. Perhaps Westminster
would have left me cold if I had
walked its aisles four hundred years ago. This
lack of maturity and not, as I suppose, the
fact that they do not come of the spirit of our
time, may be what is the matter with our newer
Gothic buildings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is one church in New York—there
may be others unknown to me—which gives the
impression of having grown out of the life
<span class='pageno' title='89' id='Page_89'></span>
which dwelt in it, in the same sense in which
certain English churches, those especially of
the Sussex country side, have grown rather
than been deliberately and consciously built.
This is the unpretentious building known as
"The Little Church Round the Corner." The
affectionate familiarity of the name suits the
place and means more to the discerning soul
than any dedication could mean. The student
of architecture would perhaps reckon this
church contemptible, and having seen it once
would bestow no second glance upon it. It is
built in no style of recognized orthodoxy. I
do not know its history, but it looks as if bits
had been added on to it time after time by
people who knew nothing and cared nothing
for unity of design, but who had in their hearts
a genuine love for the building. It is an expression
of life, this little church, but not, I
think, of the life of New York. It is as if
someone had made a little garden and filled it
with all kinds of delicate sweet-smelling flowers
in a glade of a mighty forest. Within the
garden are the flowers, tended and well-beloved.
<span class='pageno' title='90' id='Page_90'></span>
Outside and all around are great trees
with gnarled trunks and far-off branches
which have fought their own way in desperate
competition to the sunlight. I could, I
think, worship very faithfully in that "Little
Church Round the Corner," but I should have
to shut New York out of my heart every time
I passed through the doors of it. Just so I
can find delight in the sweetness of Keble's
"Christian Year," but while I do I must forget
the sea, and how "at his word the stormy
wind ariseth which lifteth up the waves thereof."
I must cease to be in love with the perils
of adventuring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is one church in New York which
seems to me to have caught the spirit of the
city, the unfinished cathedral of St. John the
Divine. It gives the worshipper within its walls
a strange sense of titanic strength striving
majestically to express itself in stone. I am
told that the building is to be finished in some
other way, in accordance with the rules and
orthodoxies of some school of architecture.
This may not be true, but, even if it is, there
<span class='pageno' title='91' id='Page_91'></span>
still remains the hope that enough has been already
done to preserve for the finished work its
character of relentless strength. If its builders
are brave enough to go as they have begun,
this cathedral should rank in the eyes of future
generations as one of the great houses of
God in the world. St. Mark's, with its fantastic
spires and gorgeous coloring, expresses
all the past history of Venice and her commerce
with the East, all which that strange
republic learnt of the Divine, from the glow
of Syrian deserts, where sun-baked caravans
crawled slowly, and from the heavy scents of
Midianitish merchandise in the market places
of Damascus. The confused and misty aisles
of Westminster embody in stone a realized
conception of the tumultuous life of London,
of its black river weary with the weight of the
untold wealth it bears, of its crowds thronging
narrow places, of its streets where past and
present look suspiciously into each other's eyes,
while things which are to be already push for
elbow room. The Cathedral of St. John the
Divine, standing on the very edge of its steep,
<span class='pageno' title='92' id='Page_92'></span>
broken hill, gives me as no other building does
the sense of strength of the kind of strength
which will do rather than endure, which is unwilling
to abide restraint of any kind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The building is a fit mate for the skyscrapers,
can hold its own among them because its
spirit is their spirit, touched with the flame of
inspiration by the torch of the divine. The
very absence of unity of style seems the crowning
glory of it. It is Attila's Hun once more.
What did he care that the spoils in which he
decked himself were of various fashionings?
It is the dynamite blasting living rock. It is,
as it seems to me, New York in process of
being given in stone an interpretation which
neither words nor music have given her yet. It
will be a loss, not only to New York but to the
world, if the builders of the Cathedral of St.
John the Divine allow themselves to be frightened
by the spectre of European artistic tradition.
They may tame their church, civilize
it, curl and comb the seven locks of its hair.
If they do, the strength will surely depart from
it and it will become a common thing.

<div><h1>CHAPTER IV<br/> <span class='sub-head'>HOLIDAY FEVER</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>We shall always be thankful that we paid a
visit to Atlantic City. It is not, I believe, one
of the places of which Americans are particularly
proud. The trains which connect it with
New York have indeed the reputation of being
the fastest in the world, but that may not be
because every one is in a great hurry to get to
Atlantic City. They run at high speed both
ways, and it is quite possible that some men
may be in an equal hurry to get away. Our
friends were certainly a little cold when we
said we were going there. Left to ourselves,
or meekly following, as we generally do, the
advice given to us by well-instructed people,
we should not have gone to Atlantic City. But
we were shepherded there by circumstance,
fate, or whatever the power is called which
regulates the minor affairs of life. And we
<span class='pageno' title='94' id='Page_94'></span>
were glad we went. No one, says Tennyson,
can be more wise than destiny. Our visit to
Atlantic City went to prove the truth of that
profound remark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The mean which destiny used for getting us
to Atlantic City was a play. We had a play
of our own, and it was produced there for the
first time on the west side of the Atlantic.
American theatrical managers believe in experimenting
with a play in some minor place
before taking the plunge of the New York
production. They call this—in a phrase not
unknown in England—"trying it on the dog."
It seems to me rather a good plan. The verdict
of the dog is not indeed of great value.
Dogs, human dogs, are the same everywhere.
They are afraid to say they like anything which
has not got the seal of a great city's approval
set on it. They take refuge in damning with
dubious phrase; and, in fact, no one with any
experience much minds what they say. But
the experimental production has a value of its
own apart from the opinion of the dog. The
company shakes down and learns to work together.
<span class='pageno' title='95' id='Page_95'></span>
The first performance in an important
place, when the time comes for it, is much
more likely to go smoothly if the actors have
faced audiences, even audiences of the dog
kind, every night for a week beforehand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We did not understand the philosophy of
these dog productions at first, and were therefore
a little nervous all the time we were in
Atlantic City, but not, I am glad to say, nervous
enough to have our enjoyment of the
place spoiled. Nothing would induce me to
say, or for a single moment to think, that Atlantic
City is in any way a characteristic product
of American civilization. All our civilizations
produce places of this kind. But it is
fair, I think, to say that America does this
particular thing better than any other country.
Superior people might say that America does
it worse; but I am not superior. I recognize
that the toiling masses have a right to revel
during their brief holidays in the way that
appeals to them as most delightful. I do not
revel in that way myself; but that is not because
I have found better ways, but only because
<span class='pageno' title='96' id='Page_96'></span>
I am growing older and prefer to take
my humble pleasures quietly. When I was
young I enjoyed tumultuous pleasures as much
as any one. I revelled with the best of my
day in the town of Douglas; and, if I did not
get as much out of it as I might now if I were
young again, it was only because there was
not, in those days, nearly so much in it. The
holiday resort has been enormously developed
during the last twenty-five years, and America,
judging by Atlantic City—and I am told
Coney Island is better—is in the very van of
human progress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have seen Portrush, our humble Irish attempt
at a pleasure city. I have seen Blackpool,
which far surpasses Portrush in its opportunities
for delight. I have seen the Lido,
where the Germans bathe. I have seen Brighton,
which is spoiled by a want of <span class='it'>abandon</span> and
a paralyzing respect for gentility. Atlantic
City outdoes them all. Atlantic City is Portrush,
Blackpool, Brighton, the Lido, and Ostend
rolled into one, and then, in all the essential
features of such places, raised to the third
<span class='pageno' title='97' id='Page_97'></span>
power, so to speak; multiplied by itself and
then multiplied by itself again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our friends, as I have hinted, warned us
against Atlantic City. They said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>"You won't enjoy <span class='it'>that</span> place."</p>

<p class='pindent'>Or, varying the emphasis in a way very flattering
to our reputations for cultivated gentility:</p>

<p class='pindent'>"<span class='it'>You</span> won't enjoy that place."</p>

<p class='pindent'>Or, altering the emphasis once more, after
we had explained apologetically that we went
there on business:</p>

<p class='pindent'>"You won't <span class='it'>enjoy</span> that place."</p>

<p class='pindent'>When we persisted in going, they took it for
granted that we wanted to argue with them.
Then they closed the discussion with an emphatic
insistence on the one word which had
hitherto escaped them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>"You <span class='it'>won't</span> enjoy that place."</p>

<p class='pindent'>One friend, mistaking us for cynical students
of the weaknesses and follies of humanity,
varied the warning in another way:</p>

<p class='pindent'>"You won't," he said, "enjoy it <span class='it'>now</span>. It's
not the season."
<span class='pageno' title='98' id='Page_98'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>They were all wrong. In spite of the private
anxiety which gnawed at our hearts, we
did enjoy Atlantic City. We enjoyed it all
the more because we went there out of season.
It is our deliberate practice to visit places of
this kind out of season, and the date of the
production of our play at Atlantic City was a
most fortunate one for us. We no longer
want to revel. The time for that is past for
us, but we do want to understand, and we seem
to get nearer that when the chief side shows
are closed, when the hotels are being painted,
and when the sea has given up the attempt to
sparkle and look cheerful. In one of Mr. Anthony
Hope's novels there is a statesman of
great craftiness who warns a Prince Consort
that he must not think he knows the Queen,
his wife, because he is allowed to see her in
her stays. I daresay there is a good deal in
the warning. But I cannot help feeling that
you would understand a queen better if you
saw her frequently, let us say in her dressing
gown, than if you never saw her except in her
robes of state, with the crown royal firmly
<span class='pageno' title='99' id='Page_99'></span>
fixed on her head with hairpins. It must be
the same with pleasure cities. One knows them,
not well, but a little better when they have
tucked up their skirts, put on old blouses and
turned to the task of cleaning up after the
festivities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is more instructive to walk along the broad
sea front of Blackpool through a fine chill mist
of January rain than to stand there on a blazing
August day when the colliers' week of
holiday is in full swing. Deeper thoughts
come to him who gazes at the forlorn rows of
notices that lodgings are to let within than
to him who hurries through street after street,
looking for some place in which to lay his
head. I am sure that I catch the essential
spirit of the Lido when the November sea is
brown, when the sands are drab, when the thousands
of bathing boxes stand locked and
empty, than I would if smiling wavelets enticed
plump Germans to splash in them and
<span class='it'>bruat paars</span> lingered, indecently affectionate,
in the shadows behind. I did once, accidentally,
see Portrush in the very height of its season,
<span class='pageno' title='100' id='Page_100'></span>
and it was a disappointment to me. Bevies
of girls, hatless but with hair elaborately
dressed, paraded the streets with their arms
round each others' waists. Critical young men,
in well-creased suits of the kind supposed to
be suitable for yachting, watched other girls
being taught to swim in a deep pool. Nursemaids
helped children to build sand castles.
Mothers of forty years of age or thereabouts
sat uncomfortably knitting with their backs
against the rocks. More than five thousand
people carried hand cameras about. Lovers,
united for a day or two, wrote each others'
names in huge letters on the sand, where the
retiring tide had left it smooth and dry. There
was too much to feel, far too much to think
about. I grew confused and desperate. I
could not understand. Out of season the observer
has a better chance. If Portrush confused
me, Atlantic City, seen in its full glory,
would have bewildered me utterly. Also out
of season I am not tormented with vain regrets.
I am spared the vexation of feeling
that a yachting suit, carefully creased, would
<span class='pageno' title='101' id='Page_101'></span>
no longer lift my heart up to the skies. It is
not forced upon me that my pulses no longer
throb wildly at the sight of girls who smile.
I do not think how sad it is that I shall never
again want to win the applause of a crowd
by taking a header into deep water from a
giddy height. I am glad that we visited Atlantic
City out of season.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I forget how many piers Atlantic City has,
but it is unusually rich in these structures, and
I have no doubt that the builders of them were
wise. A pier makes an irresistible appeal to
the pleasure-seeker. He would rather dance
on a pier, under proper shelter, of course, and
on a good floor, than in a well-appointed salon
on solid land. He would rather eat ices on a
pier than in an ordinary shop, though he has
to pay more for them, the cost of the ice being
the same and the two pence for entry into the
enchanted region being an extra. A cinematograph
show draws more customers if it is on a
pier. The reason of this is that the normal
and properly constituted holiday-maker wants
to get as much sea as he can. When he is not
<span class='pageno' title='102' id='Page_102'></span>
in it he likes to have it all round him, or as
nearly all round him as possible without going
in a boat. Boats, for several reasons, are undesirable.
They sometimes make people sick.
They are expensive. They demand an undivided
allegiance. You cannot have a cinematograph,
for instance, in a boat. The nearest
thing to a boat is a pier. It is almost surrounded
by the sea. That is why piers are a
regular feature of up-to-date pleasure cities,
and why Atlantic City has so many of them.
It is all to the credit of our revelers that they
love to be near the sea, to feel it round them,
to hear it splashing under their feet. The sea
is the cleanest thing there is. You can vulgarize
it, but it is almost impossible, except at the
heads of long estuaries, to dirty it. It seems
as if pleasure-seekers, who are also seekers of
the sea, must be essentially clean people, clean-hearted,
otherwise they would not feel as
strongly impelled as they evidently do to get
into touch with the ocean. And it is real ocean
at Atlantic City. Far out one sees ships passing,
the lean three-masted schooners of the
<span class='pageno' title='103' id='Page_103'></span>
American coasting trade, trawlers in fleets,
tramp steamers, companionless things, all of
these given to the real business of the sea, not
to pleasure voyaging. The eye lingers on
them, and it is hard afterwards to adjust the
focus of the mental vision to the long wooden
parade, itself almost a pier, the flaunting sky
signs, the innumerable tiny shops where every
kind of useless thing is sold. Atlantic City
has, indeed, some boats of its own, boats which
go out from a haven tucked away behind the
north corner of the parade, and pass up and
down across the sea front. Their sails are
covered with huge advertisements of cigarettes
and chewing gums. They are manned,
no doubt, by the kind of longshoremen who
cater for the trippers' pleasure. They have in
them as passengers whoever in America corresponds
to the London cockney. Among
ships which sail these are surely as the women
of the streets. But you cannot altogether degrade
a boat. She retains some pathetic remnant
of her dignity, even if you make her sails
into advertisement hoardings. It was good to
<span class='pageno' title='104' id='Page_104'></span>
watch these boats, their masts set far forward,
after the American catboat fashion, making
short, swift tacks among the sand banks over
which the Atlantic rollers foamed threateningly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is easy to understand why the shops along
seafronts of places like Atlantic City are for
the most part devoted to the sale of useless
things. Picture postcards I reckon to be very
nearly useless. They give a transient gleam
of pleasure to the buyer, none at all to the
person who receives them. The whole class of
goods called souvenirs is entirely useless. The
photographs taken by seaside artists are not
such as can give any satisfaction to the sitters
afterwards. Yet the impulse to buy these
things and to be photographed is almost irresistible.
We yielded, not to the seductions of
the photographers, nor to the lure of the souvenir-sellers,
but with shameless self-abandonment
to the postcard shops. I found it very
hard to pass any of them without buying. I
still have many of the Atlantic City postcards,
and I look at them whenever I feel in danger
<span class='pageno' title='105' id='Page_105'></span>
of growing conceited in order to reduce myself
to a proper condition of humility. We
also—moved by what strange impulse?—bought
several instruments for cutting up potatoes.
Under ordinary circumstances a potato-chopper
has no attractions whatever for
me. I could pass a shop window filled with
them and not feel one prick of covetous desire.
And Atlantic City, of all places in the
world, was for us—I suppose in some degree
for every visitor—most unsuitable for the purchase
of kitchen utensils. We knew, even
while we bought them, that we should have to
haul them with us round America and back
across the Atlantic, that they would be a perpetual
nuisance to us all the time, and in all
probability no use whatever when we got them
home. Yet we bought them. If the dollar we
spent on them had been the last we possessed
we should have bought them all the same.
Such is the strange effect of places like Atlantic
City on people who are in other places
sane enough. I can analyze and understand
the impulse well enough though I cannot resist
<span class='pageno' title='106' id='Page_106'></span>
it. It is the holiday spirit of the place
which gets a hold on visitors. All a whole
long year we commonplace people, who are not
millionaires, are spending our money warily
on things of carefully calculated usefulness.
We watch each shilling and see that it buys
its full worth of something which will make
life more tolerable or pleasant. Then comes
the brief holiday, and with it the sudden loosing
of all bonds of ordinary restraint. Our
souls revolt against spending money on things
which are any real good to us. We want, we
are compelled to fling it from us, asking in
exchange nothing but trifles light as air. In
desperate reaction against the tyranny of domestic
economics we even insist on buying
things, like potato cutters, which will be an
actual encumbrance to us afterwards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cowper represents John Gilpin's wife as
insisting on taking her own wine on a pleasure
party and writes of her that</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>"Though on pleasure she was bent</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;She had a frugal mind."</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='107' id='Page_107'></span></p>
<p class='noindent'>I refuse to believe that of any human being,
and I count Cowper a good poet but a bad
psychologist. The man who brought a load
of potato-cutters down to Atlantic City was
probably not a poet at all, but he had a profound
knowledge of human nature. He knew
that he would sell the things there. It was
the place of all places in the world for his
trade. It is a high tribute to Atlantic City
as a holiday resort that it forced us to buy
two of these machines. None of the other
pleasure cities we have visited have had such a
drastic effect upon us. Postcards we yield to
everywhere. Even the dreariest of second-rate
watering places can sell them to us. In
Blackpool I found a paper-knife irresistible.
In Portrush I once bought a colored mug.
Atlantic City alone could have sold me potato-choppers,
two of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In towns and rural districts where men and
women live their ordinary lives, work, love and
ultimately die, it is the rarest thing possible
to see any grown person wheeled about in a
perambulator or bath chair. Occasionally some
<span class='pageno' title='108' id='Page_108'></span>
pitiful victim of a surgeon's skill is lifted out
of the door of a nursing home and placed
tenderly in one of these vehicles. He is
wheeled about in the fresh air in obedience to
the doctor's orders, no doubt in hope that he
will recover sufficient strength to make another
operation possible. But a bath chair, even now
when surgery has become a recognized form of
sport, is a very unusual sight. In all pleasure
cities it is quite common. In Brighton,
for instance, or at Bournemouth, any one who
can, with any chance of being believed, represent
himself as an invalid, takes advantage of
his infirmity to get himself wheeled about in
a bath chair. At international exhibitions and
in some of the greater picture galleries which
are also pleasure resorts it is generally possible
to hire a bath chair. Atlantic City, being, as
I believe, the greatest of all such places, has
devised a kind of glorified perambulator, something
far more seductive than a bath chair.
It has room for two in it, and this in itself is
a great advance. It has the neatest imaginable
hood, which you can pull over you in case
<span class='pageno' title='109' id='Page_109'></span>
of rain or if you desire privacy. It looks something
like a very small but sumptuously appointed
motor car.</p>

<p class='pindent'>You need not even pretend to be a cripple
in Atlantic City in order to make good your
right to enter one of these chairs. All sorts
of people, brisk-looking young girls and men
whose limbs are plainly sound, are wheeled
about, not only shamelessly but with evident
enjoyment. There are immense numbers of
these vehicles, more, surely, than there are invalids
in the whole world. Out of season,
when we saw them, they are absurdly cheap,
almost the only thing in America except oysters
and chocolates, and, curiously enough, silk
stockings, which are cheap judged by European
standards. I longed very earnestly to
go in one of these vehicles, but at the last moment
I always shrank from the strangeness
of it. Neither the taxi of the London streets
nor the outside car of my native land ever
made so strong an appeal to me as these perambulators
of Atlantic City. I suppose it was
the holiday spirit of the place again. Girls
<span class='pageno' title='110' id='Page_110'></span>
and young men, certainly middle-aged men,
would feel like fools if they sat in perambulators
anywhere else, but it is a sweet and pleasant
thing—according to a Latin poet who
must have known—to play the fool in the
proper place. Atlantic City is the proper
place. Hence the enormous numbers of perambulators.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hotels in Atlantic City are, most of
them, as fantastic in appearance as the place
itself. I imagine that the architects who
planned them must, before they began their
work, have been kept for weeks on the sea-front
and forced to go to all the entertainments
which offered themselves by day and
night. They were probably fed on crab dressed
in various ways and given gin rickeys to drink.
Then, when allowed to drop to sleep in the
early morning, they would naturally dream.
At the end of a fortnight or so of this treatment
their dreams would be imprinted on their
memories and they would draw plans of hotels
suitable for Atlantic City. Only in this way,
I think, can some of the newer hotels have
<span class='pageno' title='111' id='Page_111'></span>
been conceived. They are not ugly, far from
it. Crab, dressed as American cooks dress it,
does not induce nightmares, nor is a gin rickey
nearly so terrific a drink as it sounds. The
architect merely dreams, as Coleridge did when
his Kubla Khan decreed a stately pleasure
dome in Xamadu. But Coleridge dreamed on
opium and his visions were of stately things.
The Atlantic City hotel is less stately than
fantastic. It is a building which any one would
declare to be impossible if he did not see it in
actual existence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It will always be a source of regret to me
that I did not stay in one of these hotels which
captivated me utterly. It was just what, as a
boy, I used to imagine that the palace of the
Sleeping Beauty must be. A look at it brought
back dear memories of the transformation
scenes of pantomimes, in the days before
transformation scenes went out of fashion. It
was colored pale green all over, and, looked at
with half-closed eyes, made me think of mermaids.
I am sure that it was perfectly delightful
inside; but we did not stay there. A
<span class='pageno' title='112' id='Page_112'></span>
friend had recommended to us another hotel,
of great excellence and comfort, but built before
Atlantic City understood the proper way
to treat architects. In any case we could not
have stayed in the pale green hotel. It was
closed. We were in Atlantic City out of
season.
<span class='pageno' title='113' id='Page_113'></span></p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER V<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE IRON TRAIL</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Our luck, which had up to that point been
as good as luck could be, failed us miserably
when we started for Chicago. The very day
before we left New York there was a blizzard
and a snowstorm. Not in New York itself.
There was only a very strong wind there. Nor
in Chicago, but all over the district which lay
between. One train was held up for eighteen
hours in a snowdrift. The last fragments of
food in the restaurant car were consumed, and
the passengers arrived chilled and desperately
hungry at their destination. We might have
been in that train. It was not, indeed, possible
for us to leave New York a day sooner
than we did; but I cannot see why the blizzard
could not have waited a little. Twenty-four
hours' delay would have made no difference
to it. It might even have gathered force.
<span class='pageno' title='114' id='Page_114'></span>
To us it would have made all the difference in
the world. We missed a great experience.
That is why I say that our luck failed us at
this point.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It would not, at the moment, have been a
pleasant experience, and I do not pretend that
we should have enjoyed either the cold or the
hunger; and we are not the sort of people who,
under such circumstances, secure the last sardine.
We should, owing to our feebleness in
self-assertion, have been among the first to go
foodless. But afterwards we could have
thought about it and all our lives told steadily
improving stories about the adventure. The
recollection of it would have added zest to
every remaining hour of comfort in our lives.
What is a short spell of suffering compared
to such enduring joys? But in these matters
we have been singularly unlucky through life.
We have never been in a shipwreck or a railway
accident or been forced to escape from a
burning house. Only once did a horse run
away with us, and it fell almost immediately
after making its dash for liberty. No burglar
<span class='pageno' title='115' id='Page_115'></span>
has roused us to do battle with him in the
middle of the night. It seems hard, when we
have been denied all the great adventures of
life, to miss by the narrow margin of a single
day the minor excitement of being snowed up
in a train.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, it is useless to complain. The
thing was not to be and it was not. Our journey
was commonplace and unadventurous. We
hired what is called a drawing-room car on our
train. This is an extravagant thing to do.
For people of our humble means it is almost
criminally reckless. Some day when we cannot
afford to have our boots re-soled, when we
are looking at the loaves in the windows of
bakers' shops with vain desire, when we have
neither money nor credit left to us, we shall
think with poignant regret of the huge sums
we spent on that drawing-room car. We shall
be sorry, at least one of us will be sorry that
we were not more careful when he or she, the
survivor, cannot afford a simple tombstone to
mark the grave of the other. But at the moment
the money, in spite of Atlantic City,
<span class='pageno' title='116' id='Page_116'></span>
being actually in our pockets, we felt that the
drawing-room car was an absolute necessity.
I should take it again if I were going to Chicago.
But then we are not yet reduced to
penury.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The alternative to a drawing-room car, on
most trains, is a section in a Pullman sleeping-car.
Against this we rose in revolt. I cannot
imagine how the Americans, who are in many
ways much more highly civilized than Europeans,
tolerate the existence of Pullman sleeping-cars.
I am not physically—though I am
in every other way—an exceptionally modest
man. I have, for instance, no objection to
mixed bathing, and it does not make me blush
to meet one of the housemaids in a hotel when,
dressed only in my pajamas, I am searching
for the bathroom. But I do object to undressing
in the corridor of a Pullman sleeping-car,
and I cannot, not being a professional acrobat,
undress in my berth. For a lady the
thing is, of course, much worse. Besides the
undressing and the still more difficult dressing
again, there is the business of washing in the
<span class='pageno' title='117' id='Page_117'></span>
morning, washing and, for most men, shaving.
You go into a sort of dressing-room to do
that. There are not nearly basins enough.
There is not room enough. Somebody is sure
to walk on your sponge, will walk on your
toothbrush, too, unless you happen to be a
clerk, and therefore practiced in the art of
holding things behind your ear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I think Americans are beginning to recognize
that these sleeping-cars are barbarous. I
met one lady who told me that she would always
gladly sacrifice a new dress in order to
spend the money on a drawing-room car. I
entirely sympathize with her; but, even if you
are prepared for these heroic extravagances,
you cannot always get a drawing-room car.
There was one occasion on which we failed,
though we telegraphed three days before to
engage one. On some of the best trains of
the best lines there are also what are called
"compartments." These are comparable in
comfort to the cabins of the International
Company of Wagon Lits on the Continental
trains de luxe, though inferior to the London
<span class='pageno' title='118' id='Page_118'></span>
and North Western Railway Company's sleeper.
No one has any right to grumble who
secures a compartment. Unfortunately, it is
not every railway company which has them,
and it is by no means every train on which they
are run.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The drawing-room car, when you get it, is
in itself a comfortable thing to travel in.
There is a good deal of room in it. There
is satisfactory lavatory accommodation. The
attendants are civil and competent. Any
one who can sleep in a train at all could sleep
in a drawing-room car if only he were not
waked up every time the train stops or starts.
Trains must stop occasionally, of course. But
there is no real need for emphasizing the stops
as American trains do. It is possible—I know
this, because both the French and English
trains do it—to stop without giving inexperienced
passengers the impression that there has
been a collision. Stopping is not a thing a
train ought to be proud of. There is no reason
why the attention of passengers should be
drawn to it forcibly. For starting with a bang
<span class='pageno' title='119' id='Page_119'></span>
there is, of course, more excuse. To start at
all is a triumph. It is a victory of mind over
inert matter, and any one who accomplishes it
wants, naturally and properly, to be admired.
I can understand the annoyance of the train,
conscious of being able to start, at feeling that
its passengers, who ought to be praising it, are
perhaps sound asleep. Yet I cannot help
thinking that all the admiration any train
ought to want might be secured without excessive
violence. Suppose a notice were hung
up in every coach: "This train will stop twice
during the night and after each stop will start
again. Passengers are requested to realize
that this is not an easy thing to do. They will
therefore admire the train." No passenger
with a spark of decent feeling in him would
refuse an appreciative pat to the engine in
the morning. We do as much for horses who
cannot drag us nearly so far or half so fast.
We do it for dogs who do not drag us at all,
only fetch things for us. We should certainly
treat engines with the same kindness if they
were a little tenderer to us. But I refuse to
<span class='pageno' title='120' id='Page_120'></span>
pat, stroke or in any way fondle an engine
which, out of mere vanity, wakes me up by
starting boisterously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We ran during the night through the tail
of the snowstorm which had stopped the train
the day before. We had left New York in
pleasant autumn weather, on one of those days
which, without being cold, has an exhilarating
nip about it. We arrived in Chicago in what
seemed to us midsummer weather, though I
believe it was not really hot for Chicago. We
passed on our way through a snow-covered
district and had the greatest difficulty in keeping
warm during the night. This is one of
the advantages of traveling in America. The
distances are so immense that in the course of
a single journey you have the chance of trying
several kinds of climate. In England you get
the same result by staying in one place. But
the American plan is much better. There,
having discovered a climate which suits you,
you can settle down in it with a fair amount
of confidence that it will remain what it is for
a week or two at a time. In England, whether
<span class='pageno' title='121' id='Page_121'></span>
you travel about or stay still, you have got to
accustom yourself to continual variety.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After breakfast, when the train had passed
the snow-covered region and the air became a
little warmer, we sat on the platform at the
end of the observation car and looked out at
the country through which we were going.
Nothing could conceivably be more monotonous.
The land was quite flat, the railway line
was absolutely straight. The train sped on
at a uniform pace of about forty miles an
hour. As far back as the eye could see were
the rails of the track, narrowing and narrowing
until they looked like a single sharp line,
ruled with remorseless precision from some
point at an infinite distance in the east. On
each side of us were broad spaces of flat land,
reaching, still flat, to the horizons north and
south of us. Every half-hour or so we passed
a village, a collection of meanly conceived, two-storied
houses with a hideous little church
standing just apart from them. Hour after
hour we rushed on with no other change of
scenery, no mountain, no lake, no river, just
<span class='pageno' title='122' id='Page_122'></span>
flat land, with a straight line ruled on it. It
was incredibly monotonous. I suppose that
the life of the people who inhabit that region
is as interesting, in reality, as any other life.
The seasons change there, I hope. Harvests
ripen, cows calve, men die; but on us, strangers
from a very different land, the unvarying
flatness of it all lay like an intolerable weight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet that journey gave me, more than anything
else I saw, a sense of the greatness of the
American people. There is, I suppose, some
one thing in the history of every nation which
impresses the man who realizes, even dimly,
the meaning of it, more than anything else
does. Elizabethan England's buccaneering
adventures to the Spanish main seem to me
to make intelligible the peculiar greatness of
England more than anything else her people
have ever done. Revolutionary France in arms
against Europe is France at her most glorious,
with her special splendor at its brightest.
So my imagination fixes on America's settlement
of her vast central plain as the greatest
thing in her story. Her fight for independence
<span class='pageno' title='123' id='Page_123'></span>
was fine, of course; but many other nations
have fought such wars and won, or, just
as finely, lost. Her civil war stirs thoughts of
greatness in any one who reads it. But this
tremendous journey of the American people
from the east to the Mississippi shores, halfway
across a continent, was something greater
than any war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>First, no doubt, hunters went out from the
narrow strip of settled seaboard land. They
pushed their adventurous way across the Alleghanies,
finding passes, camping in strange
fastnesses. They came upon the westward-flowing
waters of the great network of rivers
which drain into the Mississippi. They made
their long, dim trails. They fought, with
equal cunning, bands of Indian braves. They
returned, in love with wildness, weaned from
the ways of civilization, to tell their tales of
strange places by the firesides of sober men.
Or they did not return. They were great men,
and their achievements very great, but not the
greatest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>More wonderful was the accomplishment of
<span class='pageno' title='124' id='Page_124'></span>
those long streams of settlers who crossed Virginia
and Pennsylvania to find the upper
reaches of the waterways which should lead
and bear them mile by mile to the Mississippi
shore. It is barely a century since these men,
home lovers, not wanderers with the call of
the wild in their ears, home builders, not hunters,
went floating in rude arks down the Ohio,
the Cumberland, the Tennessee. With unimaginable
courage and faith they took with them
women, children, cattle, and household plenishing.
Somewhere each ark grounded and
the work of settlement began. I saw the
woods which stretch for miles over rolling
hills and round lakes beyond that curious colony
of very wealthy people at Tuxedo. My
imagination pictured for me, as I gazed at
these woods, the outpost settlements of one
hundred years ago. The "half-faced camp,"
rudest of the dwellings of civilized man, was
built. Trees were "girdled" or cut down with
patient toil. A small clearing was made amid
the interminable miles of forest land. I imagined
the men, lean and grim, the anxious
<span class='pageno' title='125' id='Page_125'></span>
women, ever on the alert because of the perpetual
menace of the Indians who might lurk
a stone's throw off among the shadows of the
trees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We can guess at the satisfaction of each triumph
won; the day when the lean-to shed with
its open side gave place to the log hut, still
rude enough; the day when some great tree,
sapless from its "girdling," was hewn down
at last; the adding of acre after acre of cleared
land; the incredibly swift growth of villages
and towns; the pushing out of settlements,
south and north, into yet stranger wildernesses,
away from the friendly banks of the
waterways. The courage and endurance of
these settlers must have been far beyond that
required of soldiers, explorers or adventurers.
Step by step, almost literally step by step,
they made this wonderful journey, conquering
every acre as they passed it. Yet we know
very little about them. Homer made a list
of the ships which sailed for Troy. Who has
chronicled the arks and rafts of these still
braver men? Camoens wrote his Luciad to
<span class='pageno' title='126' id='Page_126'></span>
glorify the voyage of Vasco da Gama round
the African coast. All England's Elizabethan
literature is, rightly understood, an interpretation
of the spirit of Drake and Raleigh. No
one has written an epic of these American
pioneer settlers. Yet surely if ever men deserved
such commemoration they did.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our train ran on and on at forty miles an
hour, and my spirit was cowed by the vast
monotony. What sort of spirit had the men
who faced it first, to whom the conquest of a
mile was a great achievement, to whom it must
have seemed that there was no end to it at all?
I wonder whether there was in them some great
kind of faith, of which we have lost the secret
now, a belief that God Himself had bidden
them go forward? Or perhaps there was
strong in them that instinct for the conquest
of nature which, whether he knew it or not,
has always been in man, which has made him
greater than the beasts, only a little lower than
the angels. Or perhaps it was hunger for life
itself, not for a fuller or a richer life, but for
the bare material existence, which sent them
<span class='pageno' title='127' id='Page_127'></span>
on, threatened by want in civilized places, to
look for ground where things would grow,
where the fruit of their toil would not be taken
from them. To find a parallel for the achievement
of these men the mind must go back to
dim ages before history began, when our ancestors—why
and how we cannot guess—learned
to light fires, chip flints, snare beasts,
make laws; groped through a palpable obscurity
toward justice and right, fought those impossible
battles of theirs which have won for
us the kingship of the world. Theirs was an
achievement greater indeed than that of America's
pioneer settlers, but of the same kind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I went to church in New York on Thanksgiving
Day, and I, though a stranger, was
given the privilege of reading aloud that wonderful
chapter in the Book of Deuteronomy
which tells how God led His people through a
great and terrible wilderness. I forgot, as I
read it, all about Israel and Sinai. I remembered
how the people among whom I was had
journeyed across their vast continent. They
are not my people. Their glory is none of
<span class='pageno' title='128' id='Page_128'></span>
mine. Their Thanksgiving Day had nothing
to do with me, but emotion thrilled me strangely
as I read. I wondered, thanked, and bent
my head with fear, so great was the past which
is remembered, so terrible the warning which
follows the recital. "Beware lest thou at all
forget the Lord thy God."</p>

<p class='pindent'>The observation car, with its sheltered platform
at the back of it, is a pleasant feature of
the long-distance American train, one which
might, with advantage, be copied in Europe.
But the best thing, the most wholly satisfactory,
about American railway traveling is that
certain trains are fined for being late. This
happens in England, I think, certainly in Ireland,
in the case of mail trains. It does them
a lot of good, but gives small gratification to
the suffering passengers, because the Post-Office
authorities take the money. In America
the passengers get the fine. Our train was
an hour and a quarter late in getting to Chicago,
and we were handed a dollar each as
compensation for our annoyance. I felt sorrier
than ever that we had not traveled the day
<span class='pageno' title='129' id='Page_129'></span>
before in the train that was delayed by the
blizzard. Then we should have got eighteen
dollars each and been able to buy several splendid
dinners to make up for our starvation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is not every train in America which pays
for unpunctuality in this way. I am not sure
that the rule applies even to express trains all
over the continent, nor do I know whether the
railway companies deal thus justly with their
passengers of their own free will. It seems
very unlikely that they do. I am inclined to
think that there must be a law on the subject,
either a law made by the State of Illinois or,
as I hope, one made by Congress itself. However
this may be, I have no doubt at all that the
law, if it is a law, ought to be made and strictly
enforced in every civilized country. I traveled
once by a London &amp; North Western Railway
express train, which was three hours late; and
I suffered a loss, was actually obliged to disperse
no less a sum than £2-18-0 in consequence.
I tried in vain to make the company
see that it ought to pay me back that £2-18-0.
I never got a penny. Yet the offense of the
<span class='pageno' title='130' id='Page_130'></span>
American company was a trifling one in comparison.
It was one hour and a quarter late
in a journey supposed to occupy twenty-three
hours. The London &amp; North Western Railway
took nine hours over a journey which it
professed to do in six. I cannot help feeling
that the English company would have got its
train to London on that occasion much more
rapidly if it had known beforehand that it
might have to pay each passenger fifteen shillings
at Euston. We hear a great deal on this
side of the Atlantic about the scandalous way
in which American railway magnates control
American legislation. It appears that occasionally,
at all events, the legislators exercise a
very salutary control over the railways.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Charges of corrupting senates are certainly
made against American railway directors.
They may conceivably be true. If they are it
seems desirable, in the interests of the passengers,
that some of the British railways
would take in hand the task of corrupting the
House of Commons in the American way. The
morals of that assembly could in no case be
<span class='pageno' title='131' id='Page_131'></span>
much worse than they are, so there would be
little loss in that way, while the gain to the
public would be immense if trains, even a few
of the best trains, were forced under heavy
penalties to keep time.

<div><h1>CHAPTER VI<br/> <span class='sub-head'>ADVANCE, CHICAGO!</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Chicago possesses one exceedingly good
hotel. We know this by experience. The
other hotels in the city may be equally good,
but we shall never try them. Having found
one almost perfect hotel, we shall, whenever
we visit that city again, go back to it. But I
expect that all the other hotels there are good
too, very good; for Chicago appears to take an
interest in its hotels. In most cities, perhaps
in all other cities, hotels are good or bad according
as their managers are efficient or the
reverse. The city itself does not care about
its hotels any more than it cares about its bootmakers.
A London bootmaker might provide
very bad leather for the soles of a stranger's
boots. "The Times" would not deal with that
bootmaker in a special article. It might be
<span class='pageno' title='133' id='Page_133'></span>
very difficult to obtain hot water in one of the
great London hotels—I have seen it stated, on
the authority of an American, that it is very
difficult—but London itself does not care
whether it is or not. The soling of boots and
the comfort of casual guests are, according to
the generally prevailing view, affairs best
settled betwen[** between] the people directly interested,
the traveler on the one hand and the bootmaker
or manager on the other. No one else
thinks that he has a right to interfere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Chicago takes a different view. It has a
sense of civic responsibility for its hotels, possibly
also for its bootmakers. I did not try the
bootmakers and therefore cannot say anything
certainly about them. But I am sure about
the hotels. It happened that there was a letter
awaiting my arrival at the hotel, the very
excellent hotel, in which we stayed. This letter
was not immediately delivered to me. I
believe that I ought to have asked for it, that
the hotel manager expects guests to ask for
letters, and that I had no reasonable ground
of complaint when the letter was not delivered
<span class='pageno' title='134' id='Page_134'></span>
to me. Nor did I complain. I am far too
meek a man to complain about anything in a
large hotel. I am desperately afraid of hotel
officials. They are all much grander than I am
and occupy far more important positions in
the world. I should not grumble if a princess
trod on my toe. Princesses have a right, owing
to the splendour of their position, to
trample on me. But I would rather grumble
at a princess than complain to a head waiter or
the clerk in charge of the offices of a large hotel.
Princesses are common clay compared to
these functionaries. But even if I were a very
brave man, and even if I believed that one man
was as good as another and I the equal of the
manager of a large hotel, I should not have
complained about the failure to deliver that letter.
The hotel when we were there was very
full, and full of the most important kind of
people, doctors. It was not to be expected that
such a trifle as a letter for me would engage the
attention of anybody.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next morning there was a paragraph in one
of the leading Chicago papers about my letter
<span class='pageno' title='135' id='Page_135'></span>
and the manager of the hotel was told
plainly, in clear print, that he must do his
business better than he did. I was astonished
when the manager, taking me solemnly apart,
showed me the paragraph, astonished and terror-stricken.
I apologized at once for daring
to have a letter addressed to me at his hotel.
I apologized for not asking for it when I arrived.
I apologized for the trouble his staff
had been put to in carrying the letter up to my
room in the end. Then I stopped apologizing
because, to my amazement, the manager began.
He apologized so amply that I came
gradually to feel as if I were not entirely in
the wrong. Also I realized why it is that this
hotel—and no doubt all the others in Chicago—is
so superlatively good. Chicago keeps an
eye on them. The press is alive to the fact that
every citizen of a great city, even a hotel manager,
should do not merely his duty but more,
should practice counsels of perfection, perform
works of supererogation, deliver letters
which are not asked for.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The incident is in itself unimportant, but
<span class='pageno' title='136' id='Page_136'></span>
it seems to me to illustrate the spirit of Chicago.
It is a great city and is determined to
get things done right. It has besides, and this
is its rare distinction, an unfaltering conviction
that it can get things done right. Most
communities are conscious of some limitations
of their powers. For Chicago there are no
limitations at all anywhere. Whatever ought
to be done Chicago will do. Nothing is too
small, nothing too great to be attempted and
carried through. It may be an insignificant
matter, like the comfort of a helpless and foolish
stranger. It may be a problem against
which civilized society has broken its teeth for
centuries, like the evil of prostitution. Chicago
is convinced that it can be got right and Chicago
means to do it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I admire this sublime self-confidence. I
ought always to be happy when I am among
men who have it, because I was born in Belfast
and the first air I breathed was charged
with exactly this same intensely bracing ozone
of strong-willedness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Belfast is very like Chicago. If a Belfast
<span class='pageno' title='137' id='Page_137'></span>
man were taken while asleep and transported
on a magic carpet to Chicago, he would not,
on waking up, feel that anything very strange
had happened to him. The outward circumstances
of life would indeed be different, but
he would find himself in all essential respects
at home. He would talk to men who said "We
will," with a conviction that their "We will"
is the last word which can or need be said on
any subject; just as he had all his life before
talked to men who said, "We won't," with the
same certainty that beyond their "We won't"
there was nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Chicago is, indeed, greater than Belfast, not
merely in the number of its inhabitants and
the importance of its business, but in the fact
that it asserts where Belfast denies. It is a
greater and harder thing to say "Yes" than
"No." But there is a spiritual kinship between
the two places in that both of them mean what
they say and are quite sure that they can make
good their "yes" and "no" against the world.
If all the rest of America finds itself up
against Chicago as the British empire is at
<span class='pageno' title='138' id='Page_138'></span>
present up against Belfast, the result will be
the bewilderment of the rest of America.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was in Chicago only for a short time. I
did not see any of the things which visitors
usually see there. I went there with certain
prejudices. I had read, like every one else,
Mr. Upton Sinclair's account of the slaughter
of pigs in Chicago. I had read several times
over the late Mr. Frank Norris's "The Pit."
I had read and heard many things about the
wonderful work of Miss Jane Addams. I had
a vague idea that Chicago was both better and
worse than other places, that God and the devil
had joined battle there more definitely than
elsewhere, that the points at issue were plainer,
that there was something nearer to a straight
fight in Chicago between good and evil than
we find in other places.</p>

<p class='line0'>"We are here," says Matthew Arnold, "as on a darkling plain,</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='139' id='Page_139'></span></p>
<p class='noindent'>In Chicago I felt the armies would be less
ignorant, the alarms a little less confused. I
am not sure now that this is so. It may be
quite as hard in Chicago as it is anywhere else
to find out quite certainly what is right; which,
in certain tangled matters, is God's side and
which the devil's. But I do not believe that
the Chicago man, any more than the Belfast
man, is tormented with the paralysis of indecision.
He may and very likely will do a great
many things which will turn out in the end
not to be good things. But he will do them
quite unfalteringly. When, having done them,
he has time to look round at the far side of
them, he may discover that there was some
mistake about them somewhere. Then he will
undo them and do something else instead with
the same vigorous conviction. He will, in any
case, keep on doing things and believing in
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was in a large bookseller's shop while I
was in Chicago. It was so large that it was
impossible to discover with any certainty what
pleases Chicago most in the way of literature.
<span class='pageno' title='140' id='Page_140'></span>
There seemed to me to be copies of every
book I had ever heard of waiting there for
buyers, and, I presume, they would not wait
unless buyers were likely to come. But I was
struck with the very large number of books
dealing with those subjects which may be
classed roughly under the term Eugenics.
There were more of these books in that shop
than I had ever seen before. I should not have
guessed that there were so many in the world.
I may, of course, have received a wrong impression.
This particular shop had its books
arranged according to subjects. There was
not, as generally in England and Ireland, a
counter devoted to the latest publications, or
a series of shelves given over to books priced
at a shilling. In this shop all books on economics,
for example, whether old or new, cheap
or dear, were in one place; all books on music
in another; and so forth. The idea underlying
the arrangement being that a customer knows
more or less the subject he wants to read about
and is pleased to find all books on that subject
ready waiting for him in rows. Our idea, on
<span class='pageno' title='141' id='Page_141'></span>
the other hand, that which underlies the arrangements
of our shops, is that a customer
wants, perhaps a new book, perhaps a ten-and-sixpenny
book, perhaps a shilling book, without
minding much what the book is about. He
is best suited by finding all the new books in
one place, all the ten-and-sixpenny books in
another, and all the shilling books in a third.
I do not know which is the better plan, but
that adopted in the Chicago shop has the effect
of making the casual customer realize the very
large number of books there are on every subject.
I may therefore have been deceived
about the popularity of books on eugenics in
Chicago. There may be no more on sale there
than elsewhere. But I think there are. Of
some of these books there were very large numbers,
twenty or thirty copies of a single book
all standing in a row. Plainly it was anticipated
that there were in Chicago twenty or
thirty people who would want that particular
book. I never, in any book shop elsewhere,
saw more than five or six copies of a eugenic
book in stock at the same time. I also noticed
<span class='pageno' title='142' id='Page_142'></span>
that the majority of these books were
cheap; not detailed and elaborate treatises on,
let us say, Weissmannism and the mechanism
of heredity; but short handbooks, statements
of conclusions supposed to be arrived at and
practical advice suited to plain people. I
formed the opinion that the study of eugenics
is popular in Chicago, more popular than elsewhere,
and that a good many people believe
that some good is to be got out of knowing
what science has to teach on these subjects.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was told by a man who ought to have
known that these books are steadily becoming
more popular. The demand for them was
very small five years ago. It is very large
now and becoming steadily larger. This
seems to me a very interesting thing. For a
long time people were content just to take
children as they came, and they did not bother
much about the hows and the whys of the business.
Grown-up men and women did not indeed
believe that storks dropped babies down
chimneys or that doctors brought them in
bags. But they might just as well have believed
<span class='pageno' title='143' id='Page_143'></span>
these things for all the difference such
knowledge as they had made in their way of
conducting the business. Their philosophy
was summed up in a proverb. "When God
sends the mouth He sends the food to fill it."
To go further into details struck people,
twenty years ago, as rather a disgusting proceeding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now we have all, everywhere, grown out of
this primitive innocence. We have been driven
away from our old casual ways of reproducing
ourselves, and are forced to think about what
we are doing. There is nothing very interesting
or curious about this. It is simply a rather
unpleasant fact. What is interesting is that
Chicago seems to be thinking more than the
rest of us, is at all events more interested than
the rest of us in the range of subjects which
I have very roughly called eugenics. Chicago
is, apparently, buying more books on these
subjects, and presumably buys them in order
to read them. Is this a symptom of the existence
of a latent vein of weakness in Chicago?</p>

<p class='pindent'>I am not a very good judge of a question
<span class='pageno' title='144' id='Page_144'></span>
of this sort. The whole subject of Eugenics
and all the other subjects which are associated
with it are extremely distasteful to me. I like
to think of young men and young women falling
in love with each other and getting married
because they are in love without considering
overmuch the almost inevitable consequences
until these are forced upon them. I
fancy that in an entirely healthy community
things would be managed in this way, and that
the result, generally speaking and taking a
wide number of cases into consideration, would
be a race of wholesome, sound children, fairly
well endowed with natural powers and fitted
to meet the struggle of life. But Chicago
evidently thinks otherwise. The subject of
Eugenics is studied there, and, as a consequence
of the study, a number of clergy of
various churches have declared that they will
not marry people who are suffering from certain
diseases. They have all reason on their
side. I admit it. I have nothing to urge
against them except an old-fashioned prejudice
in favor of the fullest possible liberty to
<span class='pageno' title='145' id='Page_145'></span>
the individual. Yet I cannot help feeling that
it is not a sign of strength in a community that
it should think very much about these things.
A man seldom worries about his digestion or
reads books about his stomach until his stomach
and his digestion have gone wrong and
begun to worry him. A great interest in what
is going on in our insides is either a sign that
things are not going on properly or else a
deliberate invitation to our insides to give us
trouble. It is the same with the community.
But I should not like to think that anything
either is or soon will be the matter with Chicago.
It would be a lamentable loss to the
world if Chicago's definite "I will" were to
weaken, if the native hue of this magnificent,
self-confident resolution were to be sicklied
o'er with a pale cast of thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At present, at all events, there is very little
sign of any such disaster. It happened that
while we were in Chicago there was some sort
of Congress of literary men. They dined together,
of course, as all civilized men do when
they meet to take counsel together on any subject
<span class='pageno' title='146' id='Page_146'></span>
except the making of laws. In all probability
laws would be better made if Parliaments
were dining clubs; but this is too wide
a subject for me to discuss. The literary men
who met in Chicago had a dinner, and I was
highly honored by receiving an invitation to
it. I wish it had been possible for me to be
there. I could not manage it, but I did the
next best thing, I read the report of the proceedings
in the papers on the following morning.
One speaker said that he looked forward
to the day when Chicago would be the world
center of literature, music and art. He was
not, of course, a stranger, one of the literary
men who had gathered there from various parts
of America. He was a citizen of Chicago.
No stranger would have ventured to say so
magnificent a thing. As long as Chicago says
things like that, simply and unaffectedly, and
believes them, Chicago can study eugenics as
much as it likes, might even devote itself to
Christian Science or take to Spiritualism. It
would still remain strong and sane. For this
was not a silly boast, made in the name of a
<span class='pageno' title='147' id='Page_147'></span>
community which knows nothing of literature,
music or art. Chicago knows perfectly well
what literature is and what art is. Chicago
understands what England has done in literature
and art, what France has done, what
Germany has done. Chicago has even a very
good idea of what Athens did. If I were to
say that I looked forward to inventing a perfect
flying machine I should be a fool, because
I know nothing whatever about flying machines
and have not the dimmest idea of what
the difficulties of making them are. If Chicago
were as ignorant about literature and art
as I am about aeronautics, its hope of becoming
the world center of these things would be
fit matter for a comic paper. What makes
this boast so impressive is just the fact that
Chicago knows quite well what it means.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are no bounds to what a man can do
except his own self-distrust. There is nothing
beyond the reach of a city which unfalteringly
believes in itself. No other city believes
in itself quite so whole-heartedly as Chicago
does, and I expect Chicago <span class='it'>will</span> be the world
<span class='pageno' title='148' id='Page_148'></span>
center of literature, music and art. There is
nothing to stop it, unless indeed Chicago itself
gives up the idea and chooses to be something
else instead. It may, I hope it will, decide to
be the New Jerusalem, with gates of pearl and
streets of gold and a tree of life growing in the
midst of it. Then Chicago will be the New
Jerusalem and I shall humbly sue to be admitted
as a citizen. My petition will, I am
sure, be granted, for the hospitality of the
people of Chicago seems to me to exceed, if
that be possible, the hospitality of other parts
of America. I am not sure that I should be
altogether happy there, even under the new,
perfected conditions of life; but perhaps I
may. I was indeed born in Belfast, and as a
young man shared its spirit. That gives me
hope. But I left Belfast early in life. I have
dwelt much among other peoples, and learned
self-distrust. It may be too late for me to go
back to my youth and learn confidence again.
If it is too late, I shall not be really happy in
Chicago.

<div><h1>CHAPTER VII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>MEMPHIS AND THE NEGRO</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Chicago is generous as well as strong.
There is no note of petty jealousy in its judgment
of other cities. Memphis belongs to the
South and is very different from the cities of
the East and the middle West. It is easily
conceivable that Chicago might be a little contemptuous
of Memphis, just as Belfast is
more than a little contemptuous of Dublin.
But Chicago displays a fine spirit. I was
assured, more than once, when I was in Chicago,
that Memphis is a good business city,
and I suppose that no higher praise could be
given than that. I never met a Belfast man
who would say as much for Dublin. But, of
course, Chicago is not in this matter so highly
tried as Belfast is. Memphis does not assume
an air of social superiority to Chicago as Dublin
<span class='pageno' title='150' id='Page_150'></span>
does to Belfast. It is not therefore so very
hard for Chicago to be generous in her judgment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps "generous" is the wrong word to
use; "just" would be better. No generosity
is required, because Memphis really is one of
those places in which business is efficiently
done. Timber, I understand, is one of the
things in which Memphis deals. Cotton is
another. I do not know which of the two is a
greater source of trade, but cotton is the more
impressive to the stranger. The place is full
of cotton. Mule carts drag great bales of it
to and from railway stations. Sternwheel
steamers full of it ply up and down the Mississippi.
I shall never again take out a pocket
handkerchief—I use the cheaper, not the linen
or silken handkerchief—without looking to see
if there is a little piece of white fluff sticking
on my sleeve. When I next visit one of the
vast whirling mills of Lancashire I shall think
of a large quiet room in Memphis full of tables
on which are laid little bundles of cotton, each
bearing a neat ticket with mysterious numbers
<span class='pageno' title='151' id='Page_151'></span>
and letters written on it. As I watch the operatives
tending the huge machines which spin
their endless threads, I shall think of the men
who handle the samples of the cotton crop in
that Memphis office. They take the stuff between
their fingers and thumbs and slowly pull
it apart, looking attentively at the fine fibers
which stretch and separate as the gentle pull is
completed. By some exquisite sensitiveness of
touch and some subtle skill of glance they can
tell to within an eighth of an inch how long
these fibers are. And on the length of the fiber
depends to a great extent the value of the
crop of the particular plantation from which
that sample comes. Outside the windows of
the room is the Mississippi,—a broad, sluggish,
gray river when I saw it; where the deeply
laden steamers splash their way from riverside
plantations to Memphis and then down to New
Orleans, where much of the cotton is shipped
to Europe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beyond the room where the cotton is graded
is an office, a sunlit pleasant place with comfortable
writing desks and a case full of various
<span class='pageno' title='152' id='Page_152'></span>
books. You might fancy yourself in the
private room of some cultivated lawyer in an
English country town, if it were not that in a
corner of that office there stands one of those
machines which, with an infinite amount of
fussy ticking, disgorge a steady stream of ribbon
stamped with figures. In New York and
Liverpool men are shouting furiously at each
other across the floors of Cotton Exchanges.
Prices are made, raised, lowered by their
shouts. Transactions involving huge sums of
money are settled by a gesture or two and a
shouted number. A hand thrust forward,
palm outward, sells what twenty panting
steamers carry to the Memphis quays. A nod
and a swiftly penciled note buys on the assurance
that the men with the sensitive fingers
have rightly judged the exact length of a fiber,
impalpable to most of us. All the time the
shouting and the gestures are going on thousands
of miles away this machine, with detached
and unexcited indifference, is stamping
a record of the frenzied bidding, there in the
sunlit Memphis office. Chicago is no more
<span class='pageno' title='153' id='Page_153'></span>
than just when it says that Memphis is a city
where business is done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Modern business seems to me the most wonderful
and romantic thing that the world has
ever seen. A doctor in London takes a knife
and cuts a bit out of a man's side. By doing
that he acquires, if he chooses to exercise it,
the right to levy a perpetual tax on the earnings
of a railway somewhere in the Argentine
Republic. No traveler on that railway knows
of his existence. None of the engine drivers,
porters, guards or clerks who work the railway
have ever heard of that doctor or of the man
whose side was cut. But of the fruit of their
labors some portion will go to that doctor and
to his children after him if he chooses, with
the money his victim pays him, to buy part of
the stock of that railway company. An obscure
writer, living perhaps in some remote corner
of Wales, tells a story which catches the
fancy of the ladies who subscribe to Mudie's
library. He is able, because he has written
feelingly of Evangelina's first kiss, to take to
himself and assure to his heirs some part of the
<span class='pageno' title='154' id='Page_154'></span>
steel which sweating toilers make in Pittsburgh,
or, if that please him better, he can
levy a toll upon the gold dug from a mine in
South Africa. What do the Pittsburgh steel
workers know or care about him or Evangelina
or the ladies who thrill over her caress? Why
should they give up part of the fruit of their
toil because an imaginary man is said to have
kissed a girl who never existed? It is very
difficult to explain it, but all society, all nations,
peoples and languages agree that they
must. The whole force of humanity, combined
for this purpose only, agrees that the doctor,
because of his knife, which has very likely
killed its victim, and the novelist because of his
silly simpering heroine, shall have an indefeasible
right to tax for their own private benefit
almost any industry in the whole wide world.
This is an unimaginable romance. So is all
business; but Memphis brought home the
strangeness of it to me most compellingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here is a dainty lady, furclad, scented, pacing
with delicate steps across the floor of one
of our huge shops. In front of her, not less
<span class='pageno' title='155' id='Page_155'></span>
exquisitely dressed, a handsome man bows low
with the courtesy of a great lord of other days:</p>

<p class='pindent'>"Lingerie, madam, this way if you please.
The second turning to the left. <span class='it'>This</span> way,
madam. Miss Jones, <span class='it'>if</span> you please. Madam
wishes to see——"</p>

<p class='pindent'>And madam, with her insolent eyes, deigns
to survey some frothy piles of frilly garments,
touches, appraises the material, peers at the
stitches of the hems, plucks at inserted strips of
lace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here are broad acres of black, caked earth
and all across them are rows and rows of
stunted bushes, like gooseberry bushes, but
thinner and much darker. On all their prickly
branches hang little tufts of white fluff—cotton.
Among the bushes go men, women and
children, black, negroes every one of them,
dressed in bright yellow, bright blue and flaming
red. From their shoulders hang long sacks
which trail on the ground behind them. They
steadily pick, pick, pick the fluffs of cotton
out of the opened pods, and push each little bit
into a sack. There you have the beginning of
<span class='pageno' title='156' id='Page_156'></span>
all, the ending of part of this wonderful substance
which clothes, so they tell us, nine-tenths
of the men and women in the world who
wear clothes. What is in between the dainty
English lady and the negro in Tennessee?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The plantation owner drives his mule along
winding tracks through the fields where the
bushes are and watches. He is a man harassed
by the unsolvable negro problem, in constant
dread of insect pests, oppressed by economic
difficulties. Men in mills nearby comb the
thick seeds from the raw cotton, press it tight
and bind it into huge bales. Men grade and sort
the samples of it. Men shout at each other in
great marts, buy and sell cotton yet unsorted,
unpicked, ungrown; and the record of their
doings is flashed across continents and oceans.
Ships laden down to the limit of safety plunge
through great seas with tired men on their
bridges guiding them. In Lancashire, in
Russia, in Austria, huge factories set their engines
working and their wheels go whirling
round. Men and women sweat at the machines.
In Derry and a thousand other places
<span class='pageno' title='157' id='Page_157'></span>
women in gaunt bare rooms with sewing machines,
or in quiet chambers of French convents
with needles in their hands, are working
at long strips of cotton fabric. In shops
women again, officered by men, are selling
countless different stuffs made out of this
same cotton fluff.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the whole complex organization, the
last achieved result of man's age-long struggle
for civilization, works on the perilous verge of
breaking down. The fine lady at the one end
of it may buy what she cannot pay for and
disturb the delicately balanced calculations of
the shopkeeper. Some well-intentioned Government
somewhere may insist that the women
who sew shall have fire and a share of the sunlight,
things which cost money. Inspectors
come, with pains and penalties ready in their
pockets, and it seems possible that they will dislocate
the whole machine. Labor, painfully
organized, suddenly claims a larger share of
the profits which are flowing in. The wheels
of all the factories stop whirling. Their stopping
affects every one through the whole
<span class='pageno' title='158' id='Page_158'></span>
length of the tremendous chain, alters the manner
of life in the tiniest of the negroes' huts.
A sanguine broker may speculate disastrously
and the long chain of the organization quivers
through its entire length and threatens breaking.
A ship owner raises rates, the servants of
a railway company go on strike. Some one
makes a blunder in estimating the size of a
future crop. Negroes prove less satisfactory
than usual as workers. The possibilities of a
breakdown somewhere are almost uncountable.
Yet somehow the thing works. It is a wonderful
accomplishment of man that it should
work and break down as seldom as it does; but
the dread of breakdown is present everywhere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Everyone, the whole way from the lady who
wants lingerie to the negro who picks at the
bushes, is beset with anxiety. But fortunately
no one ever really feels more than his own immediate
share of it. The cotton planter will
indeed be affected seriously by an epidemic of
speculation in New York, or a strike in Lancashire
or the legislation of some well-meaning
government. He knows all this, but it does
<span class='pageno' title='159' id='Page_159'></span>
not actually trouble him much. He has his
own particular worry and it is at him so constantly
that it leaves all the other worries no
time to get at him at all. His worry is the
negro.</p>

<p class='pindent'>According to the theory of the American
constitution the negro is a free man, a brother,
as responsible as anyone else for the due ordering
of the state. In actual practice the negro
is either slowly emerging from the slave status
or slowly sinking back to it again. It does not
matter which way you look at it, the essential
thing is, whichever way he is going, he is not
yet settled down in either position. It is impossible—on
account of the law—to treat him
as a slave. It is impossible—on account of his
nature, so I am told—to treat him as a free
man. He is somewhere in between the two.
He is economically difficult and socially undesirable.
But he is the only means yet discovered
of getting cotton picked. If anyone
would invent a machine for picking cotton he
would benefit the world at large immensely and
make the cotton planter, save for the fear of
<span class='pageno' title='160' id='Page_160'></span>
certain insects, a happy man. But the shape of
the cotton bush renders it very difficult to get
the cotton off it except by the use of the human
finger and thumb. We are not nearly so clever
at inventing things as we think we are. The
cotton bush has so far defeated us. The negro,
who supplies the finger and thumb, has
very nearly defeated us too. It is hard to get
him to work at all and still harder to keep him
at it. He does not seem to be responsive to
the ordinary rules of political economy. If he
can earn enough in one day to keep him for
three days he sees no sense in working during
the other two.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The southern American does not seem to be
trying to solve this negro problem. He makes
all sorts of makeshift arrangements, tries
plans which may work this year and next year
but which plainly will not work for very many
years. These seem the best he can do. Perhaps
they are the best anyone could do. Perhaps
it is always wisest to be content to keep
things going and to let the remoter future take
care of itself. The cotton crop has to be
<span class='pageno' title='161' id='Page_161'></span>
picked somehow this year, and it may have to
be picked next year too. After that—well
nobody speculates in futures as far ahead as
1916.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The problem of the social position of the
negro seems to be quite as difficult to solve
as that created by his indifference to the laws
of political economy. The "man and brother"
theory has broken down hopelessly and the
line drawn between the white and colored parts
of the population in the South is as well defined
and distinct as any line can be. The
stranger is told horrible tales of negro doings
and is convinced that the white men believe
them by the precautions they take for the protection
of women. There may be a good deal
of exaggeration about these stories, and in any
case the morality or immorality of the negro
is not the most difficult element in the problem.
Education, the steady enforcement of law, and
the gradual pressure of civilization will no
doubt in time render outrages rarer. It is at
all events possible to look forward hopefully.
The real difficulty seems to me to lie in the
<span class='pageno' title='162' id='Page_162'></span>
strong, contemptuous dislike which white people
who are brought into close contact with negroes
almost invariably seem to feel for them.
In the northern parts of America where negroes
form a very small part of the population,
this feeling does not exist. A northern American
or an Englishman would not feel that he
were insulted if he were asked to sit next a
negro at a public banquet. A southern American
would decline an invitation if he thought it
likely that he would be called upon to do such a
thing. A southern lady, who happened to be
in New York, was offered by a polite stranger
a seat in a street car next a negro. She indignantly
refused to occupy it. The very offer
was an outrage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The feeling would be intelligible if it were
the outcome of instinctive physical prejudice.
An Englishwoman, who had hardly ever come
into contact with a negro, once found herself
seated at tea in the saloon of a steamer opposite
a negress who was in charge of some white
children. She found it impossible to help herself
to cake from the dish from which the negress
<span class='pageno' title='163' id='Page_163'></span>
had helped herself. The idea of doing
so filled her with a sense of sickness. Yet she
did not feel herself insulted or outraged at
being placed where she was. A southern American
woman would have felt outraged. But
the southern American woman has no instinctive
shrinking from physical contact with black
people. She is accustomed to it. She has at
home a black cook who handles the food of the
household, a black nurse who minds the children,
perhaps a black maid who performs for
her all sorts of intimate acts of service. As
servants she has no objection to negroes.
There is in her nothing corresponding to the
Englishwoman's instinctive shrinking from the
touch of a black hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor is the southern American's contempt
for the negroes anything at all analogous to
the contempt which most people feel for those
who are plainly their inferiors. A brave man
has a thoroughly intelligible contempt for one
who has shown himself to be a coward. But
this is an entirely different thing, different in
kind, not merely in degree, from a southern
<span class='pageno' title='164' id='Page_164'></span>
white man's contempt for a negro. It is the existence
of this feeling, intensely strong and
very difficult to explain, which makes the problem
of the negro's social future seem hopeless
of solution. No moral or intellectual advance
which the negro can make affects this feeling
in the slightest. It is not the brutalized negro
or the ignorant negro, but the negro, whom the
white man refuses to recognize as a possible
equal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Memphis, in spite of its negro problem,
seems to me to be rapidly emerging from the
ruins of one civilization and to be pressing forward
to take a foremost place in another. I
do not suppose that Memphis now regrets the
past very much or even thinks often of the
terrible humiliation of the Civil War and the
years of blank hopeless ruin which followed it.
There was that indeed in the past which must
have left indelible marks behind it. It was not
easy for a proud people, essentially aristocratic
in their outlook upon life, to accept defeat
at the hands of men whom they looked
down upon. It is not easy to forget the intolerable
<span class='pageno' title='165' id='Page_165'></span>
injustice which, inevitably, I suppose,
followed the defeat. But Memphis is looking
forward and not back, is grasping at the possibilities
of the future rather than brooding
over the past.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But if Memphis and the South generally
are content to forget the past, it does not follow
that the past has forgotten them. The
spirit of the older civilization abides. It haunts
the new life like some pathetic ghost, doomed
to wander helplessly among people who no
longer want to see it. There is a certain suavity
about Memphis which the stranger feels
directly he touches the life of the place. It is
a lingering perfume, delicate, faint but appreciable.
I am told that it is to be traced to
Europe, that the business men in Memphis
have closer relations with England, Austria
and Russia than with the northern states of
their own country. I am also told that we
must look to the origin of it to the Cavalier
settlers of the southern states from whom the
people who live there now claim descent. I
do not like either explanation. A man does
<span class='pageno' title='166' id='Page_166'></span>
not catch suavity by doing business with Lancashire.
The quality is not one on which the
northern Englishman prides himself, or indeed
which is very obvious in his way of living. The
blood of those original cavaliers, gentlemen all
of them I am sure, must have got a good deal
mixed in the course of the last two hundred
years, especially as strangers are always pouring
into the South. It must be an attenuated
fluid now, scarcely capable of flavoring perceptibly
a new and vigorous life. I prefer my
own hypothesis of a ghost. Some of these
creatures smell of sulphur and leave a reek of it
behind them when they pay visits to their old
homes on earth. Others betray their presence
by the damp, cold earthy air they bring with
them from the tombs in which their bodies were
laid. This Memphis ghost, which no one in
Memphis sees, but which yet has its influence
on Memphis life, is of quite a different kind.
It is scented with pot-pourri, and the delicate
rose water which great ladies of bygone generations
made and used. It is the ghost of
some grande dame like Madame Esmond, who
<span class='pageno' title='167' id='Page_167'></span>
owned slaves and used them with no misgiving
about her right to do so, whose pride was very
great, whose manners were dignified, whose
ways among those of her own caste were exceedingly
gracious. There is something, some
lingering suggestion of great ladies about
Memphis still, in spite of its new commercial
prosperity. I think it must be because the
spirits of them haunt the place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Someone must surely have written a book
on the philosophy of American place names.
The subject is an interesting one, and the world
has a lot of authors in it. It cannot have escaped
them all. But I have not seen the book.
If I ever do see it I shall turn straight to the
chapter which deals with Memphis and Cairo,
for I very much want to know how those two
places came to have Egypt for their godfather.
Most American place names are easy
enough to understand, and they seem to me to
surpass, in their fascinating suggestion of romance,
our older Irish and English names. It
is, of course, interesting to know that all the
chesters in England—Colchester, Dorchester,
<span class='pageno' title='168' id='Page_168'></span>
Manchester and Chester itself—were once Roman
camps; and that most of the Irish kils—Kilkenny,
Kildare, Killaloe, Kilrush—were
the churches of once honored saints. But the
Romans and the saints are very remote. They
were important people in their day no doubt,
but it is very hard to feel the personal touch
of them now. American place names bring us
closer to men with whom we feel that we can
sympathize. There is a whole range of names
taken straight from old homes, New York,
for instance, Boston, New Orleans. We do
not need to go back in search of emotions to
the original meaning of York or to worry
over the derivation of Orleans. It is enough
for us that these names suggest all the pathetic
nostalgia of exiles. The men who named these
places must have been thinking of dearly loved
cathedral towers, of the streets and market
places of country towns whose every detail was
well remembered and much regretted, of homes
which they would scarcely hope to see again.
It is not hard, either, to catch the spirit of the
Puritan settlers in theological and biblical
<span class='pageno' title='169' id='Page_169'></span>
names, in Philadelphia, Salem and so forth.
The men who gave these names to their new
homes must have felt that like Abraham they
had gone forth from their kindred and their
people, from the familiar Ur of the Chaldees,
to seek a country, to find that better city whose
builder and maker is God. Philadelphia is
perhaps to-day no more remarkable for the
prevalence of brotherly love among its people
than any other city is. But there were great
thoughts in the minds of the men who named
it first; and reading the name to-day, even in
a railway guide, our hearts are lifted up into
some sort of communion with theirs. Then
there are the Indian names, of lakes, mountains
and rivers chiefly, but occasionally of
cities too. Chicago is a city with an Indian
name. Perhaps these are of all the most suggestive
of romance. It must have been the
hunters and explorers, pioneers of the pioneers,
who fixed these names. One imagines these
men, hardened with intolerable toil, skilled in
all the lore of wild life, brave, adventurous,
picking up here and there a word or two of
<span class='pageno' title='170' id='Page_170'></span>
Indian speech, adopting Indian names for
places which they had no time to name themselves,
handing on these strange syllables to
those who came after them to settle and to
build. Greater, so it seems, than the romance
of the homesick exile, greater than the romance
of the Puritan with his Bible in his
hand, is the wild adventurousness which comes
blown to us across the years in these Indian
names.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But there are names like Memphis which
entirely baffle the imagination. It is almost
impossible to think that the people who named
that place were homesick for Egypt. What
would Copts be doing on the shores of the
Mississippi? How could they have got there?
Nor is it easy to think of any emotion which
the name Memphis would be likely to stir in
the mind of a settler. Memphis means nothing
to most men. It is easy to see why there
should be an American Rome. A man might
never have been in Rome, might have no more
than the barest smattering of its history, yet
the name would suggest to him thoughts of
<span class='pageno' title='171' id='Page_171'></span>
imperial greatness. Any one who admires imperial
greatness would be inclined to call a new
city Rome. But Memphis suggests nothing
to most of us, and to the few is associated
only with the worship of some long forsaken
gods. I can understand Indianapolis. There
was Indiana to start with, a name which anyone
with a taste for sonorous vowel sounds
might easily make out of Indian. The Greek
termination is natural enough. It gives a very
desirable suggestion of classical culture to a
scholar. But a scholar would be driven far
afield indeed before he searched out Memphis
for a name.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I asked several learned and thoughtful people
how Memphis came by its name. I got no
answer which was really satisfactory. It was
suggested to me that cotton grows in Egypt
and also in the neighborhood of Memphis.
But cotton does not immediately suggest
Egypt to the mind. Mummies suggest Egypt.
So, though less directly, does corn. If a caché
of mummies had been discovered on the banks
of the Mississippi it would be easy to account
<span class='pageno' title='172' id='Page_172'></span>
for Memphis. If Tennessee were a great
wheat state one could imagine settlers saying
"There is corn in Egypt, according to the
Scriptures. Let us call our new city by an
Egyptian name." But I doubt whether cotton
suggested Memphis. It certainly did not
suggest Cairo, for Cairo is not a cotton place.
I was told,—though without any strong conviction—that
the sight of the Mississippi reminded
somebody once of the Nile. It would
of course remind an Egyptian fellah of the
Nile; but the original settlers in Memphis
were almost certainly not Egyptian fellaheen.
Why should it remind any one else of the Nile?
It reminds me of the Shannon, and I should
probably have wanted to call Memphis Athlone
if I had had a voice in the naming of it.
It would remind an Englishman of the Severn,
a German of the Rhine, an Austrian of the
Danube, a Spaniard—it was, I think, a Spaniard
who went there first—of the Guadalquiver.
I cannot believe that the sight of a
very great river naturally suggests the Nile to
<span class='pageno' title='173' id='Page_173'></span>
anyone who is not familiar with Egypt beforehand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is indeed true that both the Mississippi
and the Nile have a way of overflowing their
banks, but most large rivers do that from time
to time. The habit is not so peculiar as to
force the thought of the Nile on early observers
of the Mississippi. Indeed there is a great
difference between the overflowings of the Nile
and those of the Mississippi. The Nile, so I
have always understood, fertilizes the land
round it when it overflows. The Mississippi
destroys cotton crops when it breaks loose.
South of Memphis for very many miles the
river is contained by large dykes, called levees,
a word of French origin. These are built up
far above the level of the land which they protect.
It is a very strange thing to stand on one
of these dykes and look down on one side at
the roofs of the houses of the village, and on
the other side at the river. When we were
there the river was very low. Long banks of
sand pushed their backs up everywhere in the
main stream and there was half a mile of dry
<span class='pageno' title='174' id='Page_174'></span>
land between the river and the bank on which
we stood. But at flood time the river comes
right up to the dyke, rises along the slope of
it, and the level of the water is far above that
of the land which the dykes protect. Then
the people in the villages near the dyke live in
constant fear of inundation, and I saw, beside
a house far inland, a boat moored—should
I in such a case say tethered?—to a tree in a
garden ready for use if the river swept away
a dyke. I suppose the people get accustomed
to living under such conditions. Men cultivate
vines and make excellent wine on the
slopes of Vesuvius though Pompeii lies, a
bleached skeleton, at their feet. I should myself
rather plant cotton behind a dyke, than
do that. But I am not nearly so much afraid
of water as I am of fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was told that at flood time men patrol the
tops of the dykes with loaded rifles in their
hands, ready to shoot at sight anyone who attempts
to land from a boat. The idea is that
unscrupulous people on the left bank, seeing
that their own dyke is in danger of collapsing,
<span class='pageno' title='175' id='Page_175'></span>
might try to relieve the pressure on it by digging
down a dyke on the right bank and inundating
the country behind it. The people
on the other side of course take similar precautions.
Most men, such unfortunately is human
nature, would undoubtedly prefer to see their
neighbors' houses and fields flooded rather
than their own. But I find it difficult to believe
that anyone would be so entirely unscrupulous
as to dig down a protecting dyke.
The rifle men can scarcely be really necessary
but their existence witnesses to the greatness of
the peril.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I saw, while I was in Memphis, a place where
the river had torn a large piece of land out
of the side of a public park. The park stood
high above the river and I looked down over
the edge of a moderately lofty cliff at the
marks of the river's violence. Some unexpected
obstacle or some unforeseen alteration
in the river bed had sent the mighty current
in full force against the land in this particular
place. The result was the disappearance of a
tract of ground and a semicircle of clay cliff
<span class='pageno' title='176' id='Page_176'></span>
which looked as if it had been made with a
gigantic cheese scoop. The river was placid
enough when I saw it, a broad but lazy stream.
But for the torn edge of the park I should have
failed to realize how terrific its force can be.
The dykes were convincing. So were the
stories of the riflemen. But the other brought
the reality home to me almost as well as if I
had actually seen a flood.
<span class='pageno' title='177' id='Page_177'></span></p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER VIII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE LAND OF THE FREE</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>We should have been hard indeed to please
if we had not enjoyed our visits to Chicago and
Memphis. We should be ungrateful now if
we confessed that there was any note of disappointment
in the memory of the joyous time
we had. Yet there is one thing we regret about
that journey of ours to the Middle West and
South. We should dearly have liked to see a
dozen other places, smaller and less important,
which lay along the railway line between Chicago
and Memphis, and between Memphis and
Indianapolis. We made the former of these
journeys entirely, and the latter partly, by day.
Some unimaginative friends warned us beforehand
that these journeys were dull, that
it would be better to sleep through them if possible,
rather than spend hours looking out of
<span class='pageno' title='178' id='Page_178'></span>
railway carriage windows at uninteresting
landscapes. These friends were entirely wrong.
The journeys were anything but dull. The
trains dragged us through a whole series of
small towns, and, after the manner of many
American trains, gave us ample opportunity
of looking at the houses and the streets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In other countries trains are obliged to hide
themselves as much as possible when they come
to towns. They go into tunnels when they
can or wander round the backs of mean houses
so that the traveler sees nothing except patches
of half bald earth sown with discarded tins
and rows of shirts and stockings hanging out
to dry. European peoples, it appears, do not
welcome trains. In America the train seems to
be an honored guest. It is allowed, perhaps invited,
to wander along or across the chief
streets. I have been told by a very angry
critic that this way of stating the fact is wrong,
misleading, and abominably unjust to the
American people. The towns, he says, did not
invite the train, but the train, being there first,
so to speak, invited the towns to exist. Very
<span class='pageno' title='179' id='Page_179'></span>
likely this is so. But it seems to me to matter
but little whether the train or the town came
first. The noticeable thing is that the town
evidently likes the train. It is just as sure a
mark of affection to lay out a main street
alongside the railway line as it would be to
invite the railway to run its line down the middle
of the main street. An English town, if it
found that a railway was established on its
site before it got there would angrily turn its
back to the line, would, even at the cost of
great inconvenience, run its streets away from
the railway. The American plan from the
point of view of the passenger is far better.
He gets the most delightful glances of human
activity and is set wondering at ways of life
that are strange to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our imagination would, I think, have in any
case been equal to the task of conjuring up
mental pictures of what life is like in these
small isolated inland towns. We should, no
doubt, have gone grievously wrong, but we
should have enjoyed ourselves even without
guidance. Fortunately we were not left to
<span class='pageno' title='180' id='Page_180'></span>
our own imaginative blunderings. We had
with us a volume of Mr. Irvin Cobb's stories
for the possession of which we selfishly disputed.
It gave us just what we wanted, a sure
groundwork for our imaginings. We peopled
those little towns with the men and women
whom Mr. Cobb revealed to us. His humor
and his delightful tenderness gave us real
glimpses of the lives, the hopes, the fears, the
prejudices and memories of many people who
otherwise would have been quite strange to us.
Each little town as we came to it was inhabited
by friendly men and women. Thanks
to Mr. Cobb they were our friends. All that
was wanted was that we should be theirs.
Hence the bitter disappointment at not being
able to stop at one after the other of the towns,
at being denied the chance of completing a
friendship with people whom we already liked.
But it may well be that we should not really
have got to know them any better. We have
not, alas! Mr. Cobb's gift of gentle humor or
his power of sympathetic understanding. Also
it takes years to get to know anyone. We
<span class='pageno' title='181' id='Page_181'></span>
could not, in any case, have stayed for years in
all these towns. Life has not years enough in
it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Besides the towns there were the people we
met on the trains. There was, for instance, a
man who went up and down selling apples and
grapes in little paper bags. We bought from
him and while buying we heard him speak.
There was no doubt about the matter. He was
an Irishman, and not merely an Irishman by
descent, the son or grandson of an emigrant,
but one who had quite recently left Ireland.
His voice to our ears was like well-remembered
music. I know the feeling of joy which comes
with landing from an English-manned steamer
on the quay in Dublin and hearing again the
Irish intonation and the Irish turns of phrase.
But that is an expected pleasure. It is nothing
compared to the sudden delight of hearing
an Irish voice in some place thousands of miles
from Ireland where the last thing you expect
to happen is a meeting with an Irishman. I
remember being told of an Irishwoman who
was traveling from Singapore to Ceylon in a
<span class='pageno' title='182' id='Page_182'></span>
steamer. She lay in her cabin, helplessly ill
with some fever contracted during her stay in
the Far East. She seemed incapable of taking
an interest in anything until two men came to
mend something in the corridor outside her
cabin door. They talked together and at the
sound of their voices the sick lady roused herself.
She had found something in life which
still interested her. She wanted very much to
know whether the men came from County Antrim
or County Down. She was sure their
homes were in one or the other. The Irish
voices had stirred her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We were neither sick nor apathetic, but we
were roused to fresh vitality by the sound of
our Irish apple seller's voice. He came from
County Wicklow. He told us so, needlessly
indeed, for we knew it by his talk. He had
been in America for two years, had drifted
westward from New York, was selling apples
in a train. Did he like America? Was he
happy? Was he doing well? and—crucial,
test question—would he like to go back to Ireland?
<span class='pageno' title='183' id='Page_183'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>"I would so, if there was any way I could
get my living there."</p>

<p class='pindent'>I suppose that is the way it is with the most
of us. We have it fixed somehow in our minds
that a living is easier got anywhere than at
home. Perhaps it is. Yet surely apples might
be sold in Ireland with as good a hope of profit
as in Illinois or Tennessee. Baskets are cheap
at home, and a basket is the sole outfit required
for that trade. The apples themselves are as
easy to come by in the one place as in the
other. But possibly there are better openings
in America. The profession may be overcrowded
at home. Many professions are,
medicine, for instance, and the law. Apple
selling may be in the like case. At all events,
here was an Irishman, doing fairly well by his
own account in the middle west of America
yet with a sincere desire to go back again to
Ireland if only he could get a living there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was another man whom we met and
talked to with great pleasure. Our train lingered,
as trains sometimes will, for an hour or
more at a junction. It was waiting for another
<span class='pageno' title='184' id='Page_184'></span>
train which ought to have met ours, but
did not. We sat on the platform of the observation
car, and gazed at the blinking signal
lights, for the darkness had come. Suddenly
a man climbed over the rail of the car and sat
down beside us. He had, as we could see, a
very dirty face, and very dirty hands. He wore
clothes like those of an engine stoker. He
was, I think, employed in shunting trains. He
apologized for startling us and expressed the
hope that we had not mistaken him for a murderous
red Indian. He was a humorist, and he
had seen at a glance that we were innocent
strangers, the sort of people who might expect
an American train to be held up by red Indians
with scalping knives. He told us a long story
about a lady who was walking from coach to
coach of a train while he was engaged in
shunting it about and was detaching some
coaches from it. She was crossing the bridge
between two coaches at an unlucky moment
and found herself suddenly on the line between
two portions of the train. The expression of
her face had greatly amused our friend. His
<span class='pageno' title='185' id='Page_185'></span>
account of the incident greatly amused us.
But the most interesting thing about this man,
the most interesting thing to us, was his unaffected
friendliness. In England a signal
man or a shunter would not climb into a train,
sit down beside a passenger and chat to him.
A miserable consciousness of class distinction
would render this kind of intercourse as impossible
on the one side as on the other. Neither
the passenger nor the shunter would be comfortable,
not even if the passenger were a Liberal
politician, or a newly made Liberal peer.
In America this sense of class distinction does
not seem to exist. I have heard English people
complain that Americans are disrespectful.
I should rather use the word unrespectful, if
such a word existed. For disrespectful seems
to imply that respect is somehow due, and I
do not see why it should be. I am quite prepared
to sign my assent to the democratic creed
that one man is as good as another. I even go
further than most Democrats and say that one
man is generally better than the other, whenever
it happen that I am the other. I see no
<span class='pageno' title='186' id='Page_186'></span>
reason why a railway signal man should not
talk to me or to anyone else in the friendly
tones of an equal, provided of course that he
does not turn out to be a bore. It is a glory
and not a shame of American society that it
refuses to recognize class distinction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My only complaint is that America has not
gone far enough in the path of democratic
equality. There are Americans who take tips.
Now men neither take tips from nor give tips
to their equals. If a friend were to slip sixpence
into my hand when saying good-by I
should resent it bitterly. Unless I were quite
sure that he was either drunk or mad, I should
feel that he was deliberately treating me as his
inferior. I should admit that I was his inferior
if I pocketed the tip. I should feel bound to
touch my hat to him and say "Thank you,
Sir," or "Much obliged to your honor." No
man is in any way degraded by taking wages
for the work he does, whatever that work may
be, cleaning boots or lecturing in a University.
But a man does lower himself when, in addition
to his wages, he accepts gifts of money
<span class='pageno' title='187' id='Page_187'></span>
from strangers. He is being paid then not for
courtesy or civility, which he ought to show in
any case, but for servility; and that no one can
render except to a recognized superior. The
tip in a country where class distinctions are a
regular part of the social order is right
enough. It is at all events a natural outcome
of the theory that some men by reason of their
station in life are superior to others. In a social
order which is based upon the principle of
equality among men the tip has no proper
place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The distinction between tips and wages is a
real one, although it is sometimes obscured by
the fact that the wages of some kinds of work
are paid entirely or almost entirely in the form
of tips. A waiter in a restaurant or an hotel
lives, I believe, mainly on tips. Tips are his
wages. Nevertheless he places himself in a
position of inferiority by allowing himself to
be paid in this way. It is plain that this is so.
There is a sharp line which divides those who
are tipped from those who are not. It may,
for instance, be the misfortune of anyone to
<span class='pageno' title='188' id='Page_188'></span>
require the services of a hospital nurse; but we
do not tip her however kind and attentive she
may be. She gets her wages, her salary, a
fixed sum. It would be insulting to offer her,
in addition, five shillings for herself. Hers is
a profession which neither involves nor is supposed
to involve any loss of self respect. On
the other hand the chambermaid who makes
the beds in an hotel is tipped. She expects it.
And her profession, in the popular estimation
at least, does involve a certain loss of self
respect. The best class of young women are
unwilling to be domestic servants, but are not
unwilling to be hospital nurses. Yet the hospital
nurse works as hard as, if not harder
than, a housemaid. She does the same kind of
work. There is no real difference between
making the bed of a man who is sick and making
the bed of a man who is well. In either
case it is a matter of handling sheets and blankets.
But a suggestion of inferiority clings
to the profession of a housemaid and none to
that of a hospital nurse. The reason is that
the one woman belongs to the class which takes
<span class='pageno' title='189' id='Page_189'></span>
tips, while the other belongs to the class which
does not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is easy to see that in a country like America
into which immigrants are continually flowing
from Europe there is sure to be a large
number of people—Italian waiters for instance,
and Swedish and Irish domestic servants—who
have not yet grasped the American
theory of social equality. They have grown
up in countries where the theory does not prevail.
They naturally and inevitably expect
and take tips, the largesse of their recognized
superiors. No one accustomed to European
life grudges them their tips. But there are,
unfortunately, many American citizens, born
and bred in America, with the American theory
of equality in their minds, who also take tips
and are very much aggrieved if they do not
get them. Yet they, by word and manner, are
continually asserting their position of equality
with those who tip them. This is where the
American theory of equality between man and
man breaks down. The driver of a taxicab
for instance can have it one way or the other.
<span class='pageno' title='190' id='Page_190'></span>
He cannot have it both. He may, like a doctor,
a lawyer, or a plumber, take his regular fee,
the sum marked down on the dial of his cab,
and treat his passenger as an equal. Or he
may take, as a tip, an extra twenty cents, in
which case he sacrifices his equality and proclaims
himself the inferior of the man who tips
him, a member of a tippable class. There
ought to be no tippable class of American
citizens. The English complaint of the disrespectfulness
of Americans is, in my opinion,
a foolish one, unless the American expects and
takes tips. Then the complaint is well founded
and just. The tipper pays for respectfulness
when he gives a tip and what he pays for he
ought to get.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is, I think, quite possible that the custom
of tipping has something to do with the difficulty,
so acute in America, of getting domestic
servants. It is widely felt that domestic
service in some way degrades the man or woman
who engages in it. There is no real reason
why it should. It is not in itself degrading
to do things for other people, even to render
<span class='pageno' title='191' id='Page_191'></span>
intimate personal service to other people. The
dentist who fills a tooth for me does something
for me, renders me a special kind of personal
service. He loses no self respect by supplying
me with a sound instrument for chewing food.
Why should the person who cooks the food
which that tooth will chew lose self respect by
doing so? There is no real distinction between
these two kinds of service. Nor is there anything
in the contention that the domestic servant
is degraded by abrogating her own will
and taking orders from someone else. Nine
men out of ten take orders from somebody.
From the soldier on the battlefield, the most
honorable of men, to the clerk in a bank, we
are almost all of us obeying orders, doing not
what we ourselves think best or pleasantest but
what someone in authority thinks right. What
is the difference between obeying when you are
told to clean a gun and obeying when you are
told to wash a jug? The real reason why a
suggestion of inferiority clings to the profession
of domestic service is that domestic servants
belong to the tippable class. Society
<span class='pageno' title='192' id='Page_192'></span>
can, if it likes, raise domestic service to a place
among the honorable professions, by ceasing
to tip and paying wages which do not require
to be supplemented by tips. If this were done
there would be far less difficulty in keeping up
the supply of domestic servants.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I find myself on much more difficult ground
when I pass on to discuss the impression made
on me by the claim of America to be, in some
special way, a free country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>"To the West! to the West! to the land of
the free." So my farmer friend sang to me
twenty years ago. The tradition survives.
The American citizen believes that a man is
freer in America than he is for instance in
England. If freedom means the power of the
individual to do what he likes without being interfered
with by laws then no man can ever
be quite free anywhere except on a desert
island. I, as an individual, may earnestly desire
to go out into a crowded thoroughfare and
shoot at the street cars with a revolver. I am
not free to do this in any civilized country in
the world. For people with desires of that
<span class='pageno' title='193' id='Page_193'></span>
kind there is no such thing as liberty. The
freedom of the individual is everywhere a compromise
between his personal inclination and
the general sense of the community. Men are
more free where the community makes fewer
laws, less free where the community makes
more. In England I can, if I like, buy, and
drink at dinner, a bottle of beer in the restaurant
car of any train which has a restaurant
car, in any part of the country. In certain
states in America I cannot buy a bottle of beer
in the restaurant car of the train. There is a
law which stops me. It may be a very good
law. The infringement of my liberty which
it entails may be for my good and the good of
society in general; but where that law exists
I am certainly less free than where it does not
exist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tendency of modern democratic states
is to make more and more laws and thereby to
confine within ever narrower limits the freedom
of the individual man. A few years ago
an Englishman could send his child to school
or keep his child at home without any education
<span class='pageno' title='194' id='Page_194'></span>
just as he chose. Now he must send his
child to school. The law insists on it. The
Irishman, in most parts of Ireland, can still,
if he likes, allow his child to grow up without
ever going to school. There is no law to interfere
with him. In that particular respect Ireland
is freer than England, for England has
gone further along the path of curtailing individual
liberty. In the matter of buying beer
England is freer than America, because you
can buy beer anywhere in England if you go
to a house licensed to sell beer. In some parts
of America there are no houses licensed to sell
beer and you cannot buy it. America has, in
this particular respect, gone further than England
along the path of curtailing individual
liberty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are several other things about which
there are laws in America which do not exist
in England and with regard to which America
is not so free a country as England is. But
there are also laws in England which do not
exist in America. The Englishman is more
or less accustomed to his laws. He has got
<span class='pageno' title='195' id='Page_195'></span>
into the habit of obeying them and they do not
seem to interfere with his freedom. The
American laws, to which he is not accustomed,
strike him as unwarrantable examples of minor
tyranny. But it is likely that the American
is, in the same way, accustomed to his laws
and is not irritated by them. He has got into
the way of not wanting to buy beer in Texas,
and does not feel that his liberty is curtailed
by the existence of a law which it does not
occur to him to break. He may be, on the
other hand, profoundly annoyed by English
laws, to which he is not accustomed. It may
strike him, when he comes to England, that
his liberty is being continually interfered with
just as an Englishman feels himself continually
hampered in America. I can, for instance,
understand that an American in England
might feel that his liberty was most unwarrantably
interfered with by the law which
obliges him to have a penny stamp on every
check he writes. It must strike him as monstrous
that he cannot get his own money out
of a bank without paying the government for
<span class='pageno' title='196' id='Page_196'></span>
being allowed to do so. After all it is his
money and the Government is not even a
banker. Why should he pay for taking a
sovereign from the little pile of sovereigns
which his banker keeps for him when he would
not have to pay for taking one out of a stocking
if he adopted the old-fashioned plan of
keeping his money there? The Englishman
feels no annoyance at the payment of this
penny. He is so entirely accustomed to it that
it seems to him a violation of one of the laws
of nature to write a check on a simple, unstamped
piece of paper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the whole, although the citizens of both
countries feel free enough when they are at
home, there is probably less freedom, that is
to say there are more laws, in America than in
England. America is more thoroughly democratic
in constitution than England is and
therefore less free. This seems a paradox,
but is in reality a simple statement of obvious
fact, nor is there any difficulty in seeing the
reason for it. Democracies produce professional
politicians. The professional politician
<span class='pageno' title='197' id='Page_197'></span>
differs from the amateur or voluntary politician
exactly as any professional differs from
any amateur. An amateur carpenter saws
wood and hammers nails for the fun of the
thing, and stops sawing and hammering as
soon as sawing and hammering cease to amuse
him. The professional carpenter must go on
sawing and hammering even if he does not
want to, because it is in this way that he earns
his bread. He therefore gets a great deal
more sawing and hammering done in a year
than any amateur does. It is the same with
politicians. The amateur politician makes a
law now and then when he feels like it. When
law-making ceases to interest him he goes off
to hunt or fish. The professional politician
must go on making laws even though the business
has become inexpressibly wearisome. Thus
it is that in states where there are professional
politicians, in democratic states, there are more
laws, and therefore less freedom, than in states
which only have amateur politicians. America,
being slightly more democratic than England,
<span class='pageno' title='198' id='Page_198'></span>
has slightly more laws and slightly less
freedom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it would be easy to make too much of
this difference between England and America.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The freedom which men value most is very
little affected by laws. Laws neither give nor
withhold it. Freedom is really an atmosphere
in which we are able to breathe without anxiety
or fear. There are some societies in which
a man must be constantly watching himself
lest he should give expression to a thought or
an opinion which is liable to offend some
powerful interest or outrage some cherished
conviction. All sorts of unpleasant consequences
follow incautious utterance of an unpopular
opinion, or even the discovery that
unpopular opinions are held. It may be that
the rash individual is looked on very coldly.
It may be that those who seem to be his friends
gradually draw away from him. It may be—this
is not so unpleasant but quite unpleasant
enough—that he is assailed in newspapers and
held up in their columns to public odium. It
may be that he is made to suffer in more material
<span class='pageno' title='199' id='Page_199'></span>
ways, that he loses business or runs the
risk of being deprived of some position which
he holds. In very uncivilized communities he
is sometimes actually treated with physical
violence. The windows of his house are broken
or he is mobbed. The dread of some or all of
these penalties makes him very cautious. He
goes through life glancing timidly from side
to side, always anxious, always a little frightened
and therefore—since fear is the real antithesis
of liberty—never free.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All communities suffer from spasmodic fits
of this kind of intolerance. In England in
the year 1900 it was not safe to be a pro-Boer,
and England at that time was not a free
country. England is now free to quite an
extraordinary extent. A man may hold and
express almost any conceivable opinion without
suffering for it. He can stand up in a
public assembly and say hard things about
England herself, point out her faults in plain
and even bitter language. The English people
as a whole remain totally indifferent to what
he says about them. If the hard thing is said
<span class='pageno' title='200' id='Page_200'></span>
wittily they laugh. If it is said dully they
yawn. In neither case do they display any
signs of anger. They succeed in giving the
stranger in their midst the impression that
nothing he does or says matters in the least so
long as he avoids crossing the indefinable line
which separates "good form" from bad. His
manners may get him into trouble. His opinions
will not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>America is free too in this same way, but
is not, I think, so free as England. There
are several subjects about which it is not wise
to talk quite freely in America. The ordinary
middle class American, the man with whom
one falls into casual conversation in a train,
is sensitive about criticism of his country and
its institutions in a way that the ordinary Englishman
is not. It may very well be that in
this he is the Englishman's superior. A perfectly
detached judge of humanity, some epicurean
deity observing all things with passion-less
calm and weighing all emotion in the scales
of absolute justice—might, quite conceivably,
rank a slightly resentful patriotism higher
<span class='pageno' title='201' id='Page_201'></span>
than tolerant apathy. We Irishmen are not
tolerant of criticism, and I sincerely hope that
ours is the better part. We do not like the
expression of opinions which differ from our
own and are inclined to suppress them with
some violence when we can. As a nation we
value truth far more than liberty; truth being,
of course, the thing which we ourselves believe;
obviously that, for we would not believe
it unless we were quite sure that it was true.
Americans are not so whole hearted as we are
in this matter. The more highly educated
Americans are even inclined to drift into a tolerant
agnosticism which is almost English.
But most Americans are still a little intolerant
of strange opinions and still have enough conscious
patriotism to resent criticism.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is the fault of a great quality. No society
can be both enthusiastic and free. It is
the tips and the equality over again. We can
not have things both ways. If society allows
a man, without pain or penalty, to say exactly
what he means, it is always because that society
is convinced, deep down in its soul, that
<span class='pageno' title='202' id='Page_202'></span>
he cannot possibly mean what he says. A man
is free to speak what he chooses, to criticize,
to abuse, to sneer, wherever his fellow men
have made up their minds that it does not matter
what he says how keenly he criticizes,
abuses or sneers. On the other hand, a society
which is very much in earnest about anything,—and
a great many Americans are—will not
suffer differences of opinion patiently and will
always be resentful of criticism. Say to an
Englishman that American football is superior
to the Rugby Union game. He will look at
you with a sleepy expression in his eyes, and,
after a short pause, politeness requiring some
answer from him, he will say: "Is it really?"
His tone suggests that he does not care
whether it is or not, but that he means to go
on playing the Rugby Union game if he plays
at all, a point about which he has not quite
made up his mind. Say to an American that
Rugby Union football is superior to his game
and he will look at you with highly alert but
slightly troubled eyes. He wants to respect
you if he can, and he does not like to hear you
<span class='pageno' title='203' id='Page_203'></span>
saying a thing which cannot possibly be true.
But he too is polite.</p>

<p class='pindent'>"There may be," he says, "some points of
superiority about the English game—but on
the whole—think of the organization of our
forwards. Think of the amount of thought
required. Think of the rapid decisions which
have to be made. Think of——But come
and see the match next Saturday and then
you'll understand."</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is still another kind of freedom—freedom
to behave as we like, freedom of manners.
This is almost as important as freedom
to speak and think without fear of consequences.
Indeed, for most people it is more
important. Only a few of us think, or want
to say what we think. All of us have to behave,
to have manners of some sort either good
or bad. It is curious to notice that, while men
everywhere are acquiescing without much protest
to the curtailment of the sort of freedom
which is affected by law, they are steadily
claiming and securing more and more freedom
of manners. We are far less bound by conventions
<span class='pageno' title='204' id='Page_204'></span>
than we used to be. There was a time
when everybody possessed and once a week
wore what were called "Sunday clothes." One
hardly ever hears the phrase now, and men
go to church in coats which would have struck
their grandmothers as distinctly unsuited to a
place of worship. Sunday clothes were a bondage
and we have broken free. There was, very
long ago, a definite code of manners binding
upon men and women when they met together.
When it prevailed the intercourse between the
sexes must have been singularly stiff and uncomfortable.
There were many things which
a woman could not do without losing her character
for womanliness, and many things which
a man could not do in the company of ladies—smoke,
for instance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is, I think, women and not men who decide
how much of this sort of liberty people
are to enjoy. If I am right about this, then
American women are more generous than
English women. There is much more freedom
in the matter of clothes in America than
England. I remember hearing an Englishwoman
<span class='pageno' title='205' id='Page_205'></span>
complain that no matter how she tried
she never could succeed in dressing correctly
in America. In England she knew exactly
the kind of gown to wear at an afternoon
party, at a small dinner, at a large dinner, at
an evening reception, in the box of a theater.
In America she perpetually found herself
wearing the wrong thing. I imagine that in
reality she did not wear the <span class='it'>wrong</span> thing, because
there is no such rigid standard of appropriateness
of dress in America as there is
in England. More latitude is allowed, and if
a gown is hardly ever correct it is also hardly
ever wrong. Every man who sits in the stalls
of a London theater must display eighteen
inches of white shirt above the top button of his
waistcoat. In America he may wear a blue
flannel shirt if he likes, and nobody cares
whether it is visible beneath his tie or not. In
England a man who dines in a very smart restaurant
must wear a tail coat and a white tie.
In America he can, if he chooses, wear a tail
coat and a black tie, or a short coat and a
<span class='pageno' title='206' id='Page_206'></span>
white tie. There is no fixed rule determining
the connection between coats and ties.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is not only the class of people who dine
in smart restaurants and sit in stalls of theaters
which is subject to rules of this kind.
Every class has its own conventions, and, so
far as my observation goes, every class is a
little freer in America than it is in England.
No English chauffeur with any self-respect
would consent to drive a motor car about London
unless he were wearing some kind of uniform.
In America the most magnificent cars
are frequently driven by chauffeurs in gray
tweed suits with ordinary caps on their heads.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I am nearly sure that it is women, the women
of our own class, who decide what clothes we
shall wear and what clothes they will wear
themselves. I am quite sure that it is they
who regulate the degree of formal stiffness
there is to be in our intercourse with them.
English women have to a very considerable
extent given up requiring from men those symbols
of respect which had long ago ceased to
be anything but the mere conventional survivals
<span class='pageno' title='207' id='Page_207'></span>
of the mediæval idea of chivalry. Men
and women in England meet on friendlier and
more equal terms than they used to. American
women have gone even further than the
English in setting themselves and us free from
the old restrictions. They invite comradeship
and have, as far as possible, swept away the
barriers to free intercourse between sex and
sex.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To some people liberty of any sort, liberty
for its own sake, will always seem a desirable
thing. These will prefer the manners of
America to those of England, but will cling
to their admiration of the Englishman's tolerance
of criticism. There are others—it is a
matter of temperament—who prefer restraint,
who like to talk cautiously, who cling to social
conventions. To them it will be a comfort to
know that in one respect the American woman
is not so free as her English sister. In England
a woman may, without loss of reputation,
smoke almost anywhere, anywhere that men
smoke, except in the streets and the entrance
halls of theaters. In New York there are only
<span class='pageno' title='208' id='Page_208'></span>
two or three restaurants in which a woman is
allowed to smoke. Even if she is indifferent
to her reputation and does not mind being
considered fast, she cannot smoke in the other
restaurants. The head waiter comes and stops
her if she tries. This may be quite right. I
do not know whether it is or not. Many very
strong arguments may be and are brought
against women smoking. It is, I am thankful
to say, no business of mine to weigh them
against the other arguments which go to show
that women are as well entitled to the solace
of tobacco as men are. What interests me far
more than the arguments on either side is the
fact that American women are in this one respect
much less free than English women. The
women of both nations smoke, but the American
woman must do it in privacy or semi-privacy.
The Englishwoman inhales her cigarette
with untroubled enjoyment in any restaurant
in London. She must dress herself
strictly as convention prescribes for each occasion.
She must be a little careful in her
intercourse with men. She has not yet got a
<span class='pageno' title='209' id='Page_209'></span>
vote. But she may smoke. The American
woman has much more freedom in the matter
of clothes. She can be as friendly with a
man as she likes. In several states she has
a vote. But society in general frowns on her
smoking and sets its policeman, the head
waiter, to prevent her doing it. I should myself
prefer a cigarette to a vote; but I am fond
of tobacco, and all elections bore me, so I am
not an unprejudiced judge. American women
may be in this matter, as indeed they certainly
are in other matters, nobler than I am. They
may gladly sacrifice tobacco for the sake of
the franchise, but I do not see why they should
not have both.
<span class='pageno' title='210' id='Page_210'></span></p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER IX<br/> <span class='sub-head'>WOMAN IN THE STATES</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>There is a story told about Lord Beaconsfield
which, if true, goes to show that he was
not nearly so astute a man as is generally supposed.
A lady, an ardent advocate of Woman
Suffrage, once called on him and tried to convince
him of the justice of her cause. She
was a very pretty lady and she spoke with
great enthusiasm. One imagines flashing eyes,
heightened color, graceful gestures of the
hands. Lord Beaconsfield listened to her and
looked at her. When she had finished speaking
he said: "You darling!" The lady, we
are told, was angry, thinking that she had been
insulted. She was perfectly right. The remark,
which might under other circumstances
have been received with blushing satisfaction,
was just then and there a piece of intolerable
<span class='pageno' title='211' id='Page_211'></span>
rudeness. It was stupid besides. But perhaps
the great statesman meant to be rude.
Perhaps, on the other hand, he was carried
away for the moment and ceased to be intelligent.
Perhaps the whole story was invented
by some malicious person and is entirely without
foundation. In any case it is a serious
warning to the man who sits down to write
about American women. It makes him hesitate,
fearfully, before venturing to say the
very first thing he must want to say. But he
who writes takes his life in his hands. I should
be little better than a poltroon if I shrank
from uttering the truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was asked by an able and influential editor
in New York to write an article on American
women. It is not every day that I am
thus invited to write articles, so I take a pardonable
pride in mentioning the request of
this American editor. It was after dinner
that he asked me, and a lady who was with us
heard him do it. I looked at her before I answered.
If she had scowled or even frowned
I should not now be writing about American
<span class='pageno' title='212' id='Page_212'></span>
women. She encouraged me with a nod and a
smile. Yet she knew—she must have known—what
I should write first of all. Upon her
head be at least part of the blame. She not
merely smiled. She went on to persuade me
to write the article. By persuading me she
helped to make me quite certain that what I
am writing is true.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The American woman is singularly charming.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Is this an insult? I think of the many
American women whom I met who were kind
enough to talk to me, and I know that this
is not what they would like to have written
about them. Some of them were very earnest
knights errant, who rode about redressing human
wrongs. It happens occasionally, not
often, of course, but very occasionally, that
women with causes are not charming. They
are inclined to overemphasize their causes, to
keep on hammering at a possible convert, to
become just a little tiresome. This is, as far
as I could judge, never the case with the American
ladies who have causes. Others whom I
<span class='pageno' title='213' id='Page_213'></span>
met were learned and knew all about philosophies
dim to me. Others again were highly
cultured. I am an ignorant and stupid man.
Very clever women sometimes frighten me. I
was never frightened in America. Others
again, without being learned or particularly
cultured, were brilliant. They were all charming.
That is the truth. I have written it, and
if the skies come tumbling indignantly about
my ears they just must tumble. "<span class='it'>Impavidum
ferient ruinæ</span>;" but I hope nothing so bad as
that will happen to me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are people in the world who believe
that we are born again and again, rising or
sinking in the scale of living things at each
successive incarnation according as we behave
ourselves well or badly in our present state.
If this creed were true, I should try very hard
indeed to be good, because I should want, next
time I am born, to be an American woman.
She seems to me to have a better kind of life
than the woman of any other nation, or, indeed,
than anybody else, man or woman. She
is, as I hope I have suggested, more free than
<span class='pageno' title='214' id='Page_214'></span>
her European sister. "So full of burrs," said
a great lady of old times, "is this work-a-day
world, that our very petticoats will catch
them." This is a true estimate of the position
of the European woman. They who wear petticoats
over here must walk warily with chaperons
beside them. But in America there are
either fewer burrs or petticoats are made of
some better material. The American woman,
even when she is quite young, can go freely
enough and no scandalous suggestions attach
to her unless she does something very outrageous.
She has in other ways too a far
better time than the English woman. American
social life seems to me—the word is one
to apologize for—gynocentric. It is arranged
with a view to the convenience and delight of
women. Men come in where and how they
can. The late Mr. Price Collier observed
this, and drew from it the deduction that the
English man tends on the whole to be more
efficient than the American, everything in an
English home being sacrificed to his good.
That may or may not be true; but I think the
<span class='pageno' title='215' id='Page_215'></span>
American woman is certainly more her own
mistress than the Englishwoman, just because
America does its best for women and only its
second best for men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I do not pretend to be superior to these
advantages. I like a good time as well as any
one. But I have other ambitions. And I do
not want to be an American woman only for
the sake of material gains. She seems to me
to deserve her good luck because she has done
her business in life exceedingly well, better
on the whole than the American man has done
his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I am—I wish to make this clear at once—a
good feminist. No man is less inclined than
I am to endorse the words of the German
Emperor and confine woman's activities to
"Kirche, Küche und Kinder." I would, if I
had my way, give every woman a vote. I
would invite her to discuss the most intricate
political problems, with a full confidence that
she could not possibly make a worse muddle
of them than our male politicians do. I should
like to see her conducting great businesses,
<span class='pageno' title='216' id='Page_216'></span>
doctoring her neighbors, pleading for them in
law courts, driving railway engines, and, if she
wanted to, carrying a rifle or steering a submarine.
I would place woman in every possible
way on an equality with man and confine
her with no restriction except those with which
she voluntarily impedes her own activities, like
petticoats, stays, and blouses which hook up
the back. Having made this full confession
of faith, I shall not, I hope, be reproached
for appearing to recognize a distinction between
woman's business in life, the thing which
the American woman has done very well, and
man's business, which the American man
seems to me to have managed rather badly.
Strictly speaking, in the ideal state all public
affairs are women's just as much as men's.
Strictly speaking, again in the ideal state, man
is just as responsible as woman for the arts
of domestic life. But we are not yet living
in the ideal state, and for a long while now
the household has been recognized as woman's
sphere, while man has resented her interference
<span class='pageno' title='217' id='Page_217'></span>
with anything outside the circle of social
and family life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is in these matters which have been entrusted
to her that the American woman has
shown herself superior to the American man.
I admit, of course, that the American man has
done a great many things very brilliantly. But
he does not seem to me to have succeeded in
making the business of living, so far as it falls
within his province, either comfortable or
agreeable. The Englishman has done better.
Examples of what I mean absolutely crowd
upon me. Take the question of cooking food.
The American man, left to his own devices, is
not strikingly successful with food. The
highest average of cooking in England is to be
found in good men's clubs. You may, and
often do, get excellent dinners in private
houses in England; but you are surer of an
excellent dinner in a first rate club. In America
it is the other way about. Many men's
clubs have skilful cooks, but you are on the
whole more likely to get very good food in a
woman's club or in a private house than in a
<span class='pageno' title='218' id='Page_218'></span>
man's club. I am not myself an expert in
cooked food. The subject has never had a
real fascination for me. But I have a sense
of taste like my better educated gourmet
brethren, and I am convinced that where the
American woman has control of the cooking
the business is better done than it generally is
in England, and far better done than when it
is left to American men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The kindred subjects of drinks, again,
marks the superiority of the American woman.
For some reason quite obscure to me, women
are not supposed to know anything about wine.
They either do not like it at all or they like
bad kinds of wine. Wine is man's business in
all countries. In America wine is dear, and
usually of indifferent quality. Man has mismanaged
the cellar. On the other hand,
women are supposed—again the reason is beyond
me—to like eating sweets, to be specialists
in that whole range of food which in
America goes under the name of candies. Men
have not created the demand for candies or
secured the supply. They are woman's affair.
<span class='pageno' title='219' id='Page_219'></span>
The consequence is that American candies are
better than any others in the world, better even
than the French. It is necessary to search
New York narrowly and patiently in order to
find a good bottle of claret. I speak on this
matter as an outsider, for I drink but little
claret myself; but I am assured by highly
skilled experts that the fact is as I state it.
On the other hand—I know this by experience—you
can satisfy your soul with an almost
infinite variety of chocolates without going
three hundred yards from the door of
your hotel in New York or Philadelphia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The one form of alcoholic drink in which
America surpasses the rest of the world is the
cocktail. I have never yet seen a properly
written history of cocktails. The subject still
waits its philosopher. But I am inclined to
think that the cocktail, the original of the
species, Manhattan, Bronx or whatever it may
have been, was invented by a woman. True,
these drinks are now universally mixed by men.
But the inspiration is unquestionably feminine.
Formulæ for the making of cocktails exist.
<span class='pageno' title='220' id='Page_220'></span>
I was once asked to review a book which contained
several hundred receipts for cocktails.
But every one agrees that the formula is of
minor importance. The cocktail depends for
its excellence not on careful measurements,
but on the incalculable and indescribable thing
called personality. The most skilful pharmaceutical
chemist, trained all his life to the
accurate weighing of scruples and measurement
of drams, might well fail as a maker of
cocktails. He would fail if he did not possess
an instinct for the art. Now this is characteristic
of all women's work. Man reaches
his conclusions by argument, bases his convictions
on reason, and is generally wrong.
Woman responds to emotion, follows instinct,
and is very often right. Man is the drudging
scientist, patient, dull. Woman is the dashing
empiricist, inconsequential, brilliant. The
cocktail must be hers. I shall continue, until
strong evidence to the contrary is offered to
me, to believe that the credit for this glory of
American life belongs to her and not to man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It would, no doubt, be insulting to say that
<span class='pageno' title='221' id='Page_221'></span>
part of the business of a woman, as distinguished
from a man, is to dress well and
be agreeable. I should not dream of saying
such a thing. But there can be no harm in
suggesting that it is the duty of both sexes to
do these things. There is no real reason why
an idealist, man or woman, should not be pleasant
to look at, nor is it necessary that very
estimable people should administer snubs to
the rest of us. It seems to me that even very
good people are better when they have nice
manners and pleasanter when they dress well.
It is not, I admit, their fault when they are
not good looking, but it is their fault if they
do not, by means of clothes, make themselves
as good looking as they can. There is no excuse
for the man or woman who emphasizes
a natural ugliness. Man, I regret to say, does
not often recognize his duty in these matters.
Woman, generally speaking, has done her best.
The American woman has made the very most
of her opportunities and has succeeded both
in looking nice and in being an agreeable companion.
In the art of putting on her clothes
<span class='pageno' title='222' id='Page_222'></span>
she has no superior except the Parisienne, and
even in Paris itself it is often difficult to tell,
without hearing her speak, whether the lady
at the next table in a restaurant is French or
American. I knew an English mother who
sent her daughter to Paris for six months in
order that the girl might learn to dress herself.
The journey to America would have been
longer, but once there the girl would have had
just as good a chance of acquiring the art. I
am very unskilful in describing clothes, and
the finer nuances of costume are far beyond
the power of any language at my command
to express. But it is possible to appreciate
effects without being able to analyze the way
in which they are produced. The effect on
the emotions of a symphony rendered by a
good orchestra is almost as great for the man
who does not know exactly what the trombones
are doing as it is for the musician who understands
that they are adding to the general
noise by playing chromatic scales, or whatever
it is that trombones do play. It is the same
with clothes. I cannot name materials, or discuss
<span class='pageno' title='223' id='Page_223'></span>
styles in technical language, but I am
pleasantly conscious that the American woman
has the air of being very well dressed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I am not attempting to make a comparison
between the clothes of very wealthy women
of the leisured classes in America and those
of women similarly placed in other countries.
Aristocracies and plutocracies are cosmopolitan.
National characteristics are to a considerable
extent smoothed off them. The women
of these classes dress almost equally well
everywhere. The possibility of comparison
exists only when one considers the comparatively
poor women of the middle and lower
middle classes. It is these who, in America,
have the instinct for dressing well unusually
highly developed. Some women have this instinct.
Others have not. It seems to be distributed
geographically. There are cities—no
bribe would induce me to name one of them—where
the women are usually badly dressed.
You walk up and down the chief thoroughfares.
You enter the most fashionable restaurants
and are oppressed by a sense of prevailing
<span class='pageno' title='224' id='Page_224'></span>
dowdiness. It is not a question of
money. The gowns which you see, the coats,
the hats have obviously cost great sums. For
half the expenditure women in other places
look well dressed. It is not a matter of the
skill of dressmakers and milliners. A woman
who has not got the instinct for clothes might
go to—I forget the man's name, but he is the
chief costumier in Paris—might give him a
free hand to do his best for her, and afterwards
she would not look a bit better dressed.
It is not, I believe, possible to explain exactly
what she lacks. It is an extra sense, as incommunicable
as an ear for music. A woman
either has it or has not. The American woman
has it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I know—no one knows better than I do—that
it is a contemptible thing to take any notice
of clothes. The soul is what matters. The
body may be in rags. The mind is what counts,
and fine feathers do not make fine birds. A
great prophet would not be the less a great
prophet though his finger nails were black. I
hope we should all adore him just the same
<span class='pageno' title='225' id='Page_225'></span>
even if he never washed his face or wore a
collar. But just at first, before we got to
know him really well, it is possible that we
might be a little prejudiced against him if he
looked as if he never washed. That is all I
wish or mean to say about the American
woman's power of dressing herself. It disarms
prejudice. The stranger starts fair, so
to speak, when he is introduced to her. In the
case of women who cannot, or for any reason
will not, dress themselves nicely, there are preliminary
difficulties in the way of appreciating
their real worth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the best clothes in the world are no help
when it comes to conversation, unless, indeed,
one is able to discuss them in detail, and I am
not. I have met exquisitely dressed women
who were very difficult to talk to. The American
woman is not one of these. Besides being
well dressed, she is a delightful talker on all
subjects. She may or may not be profound.
I am not profound myself, so I have no way
of judging about that. But profoundness is
not wanted in conversation. Its proper place
<span class='pageno' title='226' id='Page_226'></span>
is in scientific books. In conversation it is
merely a nuisance, and the American woman,
when she is profound, has more sense than to
show it. She talks well because she is not in
the least shy or self-conscious. Even young
American girls are not shy. Brought into sudden
contact with a middle-aged man, they treat
him as an equal, with a frank sense of comradeship.
They have, apparently, no awe of
advanced or advancing years. They do not
pretend to think that elderly people are in any
way their superiors, or display in the presence
of the aged that kind of chilling aloofness
which is called respect. I detest people who
behave as if they respected me because I am
older than they are. I recognize at once that
they are hypocrites. Boys and girls must
know, in their hearts, just as well as we do,
that respect is due to the young from the elderly
and not the other way about. The ancient
Romans understood this: "<span class='it'>Maxima debitur
reverentia pueris</span>" is in the Latin grammar,
and the Latin grammar is a good authority
<span class='pageno' title='227' id='Page_227'></span>
on all subjects connected with ancient Roman
civilization.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is her power of making herself agreeable
which is the greatest charm of the American
woman, a greater charm than her ability in
dressing. I am a man very little practiced in
the art of conversation. A dinner party—a
party of any kind, but particularly a dinner
party—is a thing from which I shrink. I am
always very sorry for the two women who are
placed beside me. I know that they will have
to make great exertions to keep up a conversation
with me. I watch them suffering and
am myself a prey to excruciating pangs of
self-reproach. But my agony is less in America
than elsewhere. The American woman
must of course suffer as much as the Englishwoman
when I take her in to dinner; but she
possesses in an extraordinary degree the art
of not showing it. She frequently deceives
me for several minutes at a time, making me
think that she is actually enjoying herself.
She is able to do this because she has an amazing
vitality and a very acute kind of intelligence.
<span class='pageno' title='228' id='Page_228'></span>
Now, the highest compliment which a
woman can pay to a man is to enjoy his company.
The American woman understands this
and succeeds in pretending she is doing it. She
is wise, too. Recognizing that even her powers
have their limits, and that no woman, however
vital and intelligent, can go on disguising her
weariness for very long, she makes her dinners
and luncheons as short as possible, shorter
than similar functions are in England. She
does not attempt anything in the way of a
long-distance contest with the heavy stupidity
of the ordinary man. Her's is the triumph of
the sprinter. For a short time she flashes,
sympathizes, subtly flatters, talks with amazing
brilliance, charms. Then she escapes.
What happens to her next I can only guess,
but I imagine that she must be very much
exhausted.

<div><h1>CHAPTER X<br/> <span class='sub-head'>MEN AND HUSBANDS</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Comic papers on both sides of the Atlantic
have adopted the marriages between American
women and English men of the upper
classes as a standing joke; one of those jokes
of which the public never gets tired, whose
infinite variety repetition does not stale. The
fun lies in the idea of barter. The Englishman
has a title. The American woman has
dollars. He lays a coronet at her feet. She
hands money bags to him. Essentially the
joke is the same on whichever side of the Atlantic
it is made. But there is a slight difference
in the way the parts of it are emphasized.
The tendency among American humorists is
to dwell a little on the greed of the Englishman,
who is represented as incapable of earning
money for himself. The English jester
<span class='pageno' title='230' id='Page_230'></span>
lays more stress on the American woman's desire
to be called "my lady," and pokes sly fun
at the true democrat's fondness for titles. I
appreciate the joke thoroughly wherever it is
made, and I invariably laugh heartily at it.
But I decline to take it as anything more than
a joke. It is not a precise and scientific explanation
of fact.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are a great many marriages between
American women of large or moderate fortune
and English men, or other Europeans, of
title. That is the fact. No doubt the dollars
are as attractive to noblemen as they are to anybody
else. There are a number of pleasant
things, steam yachts, for instance, which can
be got by those who have dollars, but not by
those who are without them. They may occasionally
be the determining factor in the choice
of a wife. But I feel sure that most Englishmen,
when they marry American women, do
so because they like them. They marry the
woman, not the money. In the same way a
title is a very pleasant thing to have. I have
never enjoyed the sensation and never shall,
<span class='pageno' title='231' id='Page_231'></span>
but I know that it must be most agreeable to
be styled "Your Grace," or to have a coronet
embroidered on a pocket handkerchief. But
I do not believe that American women marry
coronets. They marry men. The coronet
counts, I daresay, but the man counts more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is interesting to notice that, although
there are many marriages between American
women and Englishmen, there are comparatively
few marriages between English women
and American men. If it were a mere question
of exchanging money for titles we might
expect English women of title to marry American
men. There are a great many English
women with titles and a great many rich American
men. They might marry each other, but
they do not, not, at all events, in large numbers.
It is true that the woman cannot, unless
she is a princess, give her husband a title,
as a man can give a title to his wife. But it
is no small thing to have a wife with a title.
It is a pleasure well worth buying, if it is to
be bought. But apparently it is not. The
English woman of title prefers to marry an
<span class='pageno' title='232' id='Page_232'></span>
English man, however rich Americans may be.
The American man prefers American women,
though none of them have titles. Exact statistics
about these marriages are not available,
but we may take the vitality of current jokes as
an indication of what the facts are. The joke
about the marriage between Miss Sadie K.
Bock, daughter of the well-known dollar dictator
of Capernaum, Pa., U.S.A., and the
Viscount Fitzeffingham Plantagenet, is fresh
and always popular. But no one ever made a
joke about a marriage between the dollar dictator's
son and Lady Ermyntrude. There
would be no point in that joke if it were made
because the thing does not happen, or does not
happen often enough to strike the popular imagination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The truth appears to be that American
women, apart from any question of their
dowries, are attractive both to English and
American men. English men, on the other
hand, are attractive both to English and
American women.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I occupy in this investigation the position
<span class='pageno' title='233' id='Page_233'></span>
of an unprejudiced outsider. I am neither
English nor American, but Irish, and I can
afford to discuss the matter without passion,
since Irish women are admittedly more attractive
than any others in the world and Irish
men are seldom tempted to marry outside their
own people. A very wise English lady, one
who has much experience of life, once said
that young Englishmen of good position are
lured into marrying music hall dancers, a thing
which occasionally happens to them, because
they find these ladies more entertaining and
exciting than girls of their own class. I do
not know whether this is true or not, but if it
is it helps to explain the attractiveness of
American women. There is always a certain
unexpectedness about them. They are always
stimulating and agreeable. It is much more
difficult to account for the attractiveness of the
English man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The manners of a well-bred English man
are not superior to those of a well-bred American
man. Nor are they inferior. Looked at
superficially, they are the same. As far as
<span class='pageno' title='234' id='Page_234'></span>
mere conventional behavior toward women is
concerned, there is no difference between an
Englishman and an American. A well-mannered
Englishman rises up and opens the door
for a woman when she leaves the room. So
does a well-mannered American. The Englishman
hands tea, bread and butter or cake
to a woman before he takes tea, bread and butter
or cake for himself. So does the American.
The outward acts are identical. But
there is a subtle difference in the spirit which
inspires them. The English man does these
things because he is chivalrous. His manners
are based on the theory "Noblesse oblige."
The woman belongs to the weaker sex, he to
the stronger. All courtesy is therefore due to
her. This is the theory which underlies the
behavior of Englishmen to women. Good
manners are a survival, one of the few survivals,
of the old idea of chivalry; and chivalry
was the nobly conceived homage of the strong
to the weak, of the superior to the inferior.
The American, performing exactly the same
outward acts, is reverent. And reverence is
<span class='pageno' title='235' id='Page_235'></span>
essentially the opposite of chivalry. It is not
the homage of the strong to the weak, but the
obeisance of the inferior in the presence of a
superior.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This difference of spirit underlies the whole
relationship of men to women in England and
America. It helps to explain the fact that the
feminist movement in England is much fiercer
than it is in America. The English feminist
is up against chivalry and wants equality. The
American woman, though she may claim rights,
has no inducement to destroy reverence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I should be very sorry to think, I should be
mad to say, that this difference in spirit has
anything to do with the attractiveness of Englishmen,
considered not as temporary companions,
but as husbands. But there are, or once
were, people who held the theory that the natural
woman—and all women are perhaps more
or less natural—prefers as a husband the kind
of man who asserts himself as her superior.
"O. Henry" has a story of a woman who
learned to respect and love her husband only
after she had goaded him into beating her.
<span class='pageno' title='236' id='Page_236'></span>
Up to that point she had despised him thoroughly.
Other novelists, deep students of human
nature all of them, have worked on the
same scheme. They are quite wrong, of
course. But if they were right they might
quote the Englishman's invincible chivalry as
the reason of his attractiveness; maintaining,
cynically, that a woman prefers, in a husband,
that kind of homage to the reverence that the
American man continually offers her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The American man strikes me as more alert
than the Englishman. If this were noticeable
only in New York, I should attribute the alertness
to the climate. The air of New York is
extraordinarily stimulating. The stranger
feels himself tireless, as if he could go on doing
things of an exhausting kind all day long
without intervals for rest. It would be small
wonder if the natives of the place were eager
beyond other men. But they are not more
eager and alert than other Americans. Therefore
we cannot blame, or thank, the climate
for these qualities. They must depend upon
some peculiarity of the American nervous system,
<span class='pageno' title='237' id='Page_237'></span>
unless indeed they are the result of living
under the American constitution. A man
would naturally feel it his duty to be as alert
as he could if he felt that his country was preeminently
the land of progress and that all
the other countries in the world were more or
less old-fashioned and effete. But wherever
the alertness comes from it is certainly one of
the characteristics of the American man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With it goes sanguineness. Every man
who undertakes any enterprise looks at it from
two points of view. He thinks how very nice
life will be if the enterprise succeeds. He also
considers how disagreeable things will become
if, for any reason, it fails to come off. The
Englishman, unless he is a politician, is temperamentally
inclined to give full weight to
the possibility of failure. The American
dwells rather on the prospects of success.
There are, of course, a great many sanguine
Englishmen. Most Members of Parliament,
for instance, must be extraordinarily hopeful,
otherwise they would not go on expecting to
get things done by voting and listening to
<span class='pageno' title='238' id='Page_238'></span>
speeches. Some Americans, though not many,
are cautious to the point of being almost pessimistic.
But, broadly speaking, Americans
are more sanguine than Englishmen. That is
why so many new faiths, and new foods, come
from America. Only a very hopeful people
could have invented Christian Science or expect
to be benefited by eating patent foods
at breakfast time. That is also, I imagine,
why Americans drink so much iced water.
Conscious of the dangers of being too sanguine,
they try to cool down their spirits in
the way which is generally recognized as best
for reducing excessive hopefulness. To pour
cold water on anything is a proverbial expression.
The Americans pour gallons of very
cold water down their throats, which shows
that they are on the watch against the defects
of their high qualities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the alertness and hopefulness there
goes, inevitably, a certain restlessness. "Better
the devil you know than the devil you
don't" is a proverb which appeals to the English
man. It could never be popular in America.
<span class='pageno' title='239' id='Page_239'></span>
The American, if he made up his mind
to go in for the acquaintance of devils at all,
would be inclined to try the newer kinds, not
merely because he would be hopeful about
them, but because he would feel sure that the
old ones would bore him. He would never
settle down to a monotonous cat and dog life
with a thoroughly familiar devil. The Englishman
prefers to remain where he is unless
the odds are in favor of a change being a
change for the better. The American will
make a change unless he thinks it likely to be
a change for the worse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We were greatly struck while we were in
America by the fact that there were very few
gardens there. The season of the year, late
autumn, was not, indeed, favorable to gardens.
Still I think we should have recognized flower
beds and the remains of flowers if we had
seen them. At first we were inclined to think
that Americans do not care for flowers; but
we were constantly assured, on unimpeachable
authority, that they do. And we were not
dependent on mere assertion. We saw that
<span class='pageno' title='240' id='Page_240'></span>
Americans adorn their rooms with cut flowers,
sometimes at huge expense. They must therefore
like flowers. They also, we were told,
like growing them; but as a matter of fact
they do not grow them to anything like the
same extent that flowers are grown in England
or Ireland. We used to ask why people
who like flowers and would like to grow them
have so few gardens. We got several answers.
The climate, of course, was one. But
it is not fair to make the climate responsible
for too many things. Besides the climate, as
I have said before, is not the same all over
America. It is difficult to believe that it is
everywhere fatal to gardening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another answer—a much more satisfactory
one—was that it takes time to create a garden,
and Americans do not usually stay long
enough in one house to make it worth while to
start gardening. It is plainly an unsatisfactory
thing to inaugurate a herbaceous border
in 1914 if you are likely to leave it early in
1915. As for yew hedges and delights of
that kind, no one plants them unless he has a
<span class='pageno' title='241' id='Page_241'></span>
good hope that his son will be there to enjoy
them after he has gone. The American, so
we were told, and so of course believed, is
always looking forward to moving into a new
house. This is because he is alert, sanguine
and a lover of change. The Englishman is
inclined to settle down in one house, and it is
very difficult to root him out of it. Therefore
gardens are commonly possible in England and
rarely so in America.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We did indeed see some gardens in America,
and they were tended with all the care which
flower lovers display everywhere. We saw
in them plants brought from very different
places, round which there doubtless gathered
all sorts of associations, whose blossoms were
redolent with the perfume of happy memories
as well as their own natural scents. But these
gardens belonged to men who either through
the necessity of their particular occupation or
through some eccentricity of character felt
that they were likely to remain in one place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gardens are generally best loved and most
carefully tended by women. I have known
<span class='pageno' title='242' id='Page_242'></span>
men who took a real interest in plants, but for
the most part men who spend their leisure
hours in gardens occupy themselves in mowing
the grass or scuffling the walks. They will
trim the edges of flowerbeds with shears, they
will sometimes even dig, but their hearts are
not with the growing plants. Often they confess
as much openly, saying without shame
that mowing is capital exercise after office
hours, or that the celery bed must be properly
trenched if it is to come to perfection. No
one who works in this spirit is a gardener, nor
is a man who merely desires a tidy trimness.
To the real gardener neatness is an unimportant
detail. It is better that a flower should
grow in a bed with ragged edges than that it
should wither slowly in the middle of the
trimmest of lawns. It is women, far oftener
than men, who possess or are possessed by the
instinct for getting things to grow. It is
after all a sort of mother instinct, since flowers,
like children, only respond to those who love
them. Probably every woman who has the
mother instinct has the garden instinct too, and
<span class='pageno' title='243' id='Page_243'></span>
most women, we may be thankful for it, are
potentially good mothers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps it is the fact that he is content to
stay still long enough to render gardens possible
which makes the Englishman attractive
as a husband. It is easy to understand that
there is something very fascinating to a garden
lover in the prospect of attachment to one
particular spot. It is a great thing to feel:
"Here I shall live until the end of living comes,
and then my sons will live here after me. All
the rockeries I build, all the trees I plant, all
my pergolas and rose hedges are for delight
in coming years, for delight still in the years
beyond my span of living." This instinct for
a settled home, of which a garden is the symbol,
is surely stronger in woman than in any
man. Woman is after all the stable part of
humanity. Man fights, invents, frets, fusses
and passes. Woman is the link between the
generations. Man makes life possible and
great. It is woman who continues life, hands
it on. Her nature requires stability. She
feels after settledness in the hope of finding it.
<span class='pageno' title='244' id='Page_244'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>If I were a philosopher I should pursue
these speculations and write several pages
about men and women which it would be very
difficult for any one to understand. But I
have no taste for hunting elusive thoughts
among the shadows of vague words. I am
content to note my little facts; that American
men are more restless than Englishmen, that
there are fewer gardens in America than in
England, that most women like gardens, and
that there are more marriages between American
women and Englishmen than between
English women and American men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I came across a curious example of American
restlessness a little while ago. There was
a footman, very expert in his business, who
lived and earned good wages in an English
house. He was an ambitious footman, and,
though his wages were good, he wanted them
to be better still. His opportunity came to
him. An American wanted a valet and was
prepared to pay very large wages indeed. The
footman offered his services, and being, as I
said, a very good footman, he secured the vacant
<span class='pageno' title='245' id='Page_245'></span>
position, and the wages which were far
beyond any he would ever have earned in
England. At the end of two years he happened
to meet the butler under whom he had
served in the English house. The butler congratulated
him on his great wealth. The footman,
now a valet, replied that there are several
things in the world better worth having than
money.</p>

<p class='pindent'>"I haven't," he said, "slept a fortnight at a
time in the same bed since I left you, and it's
killing me."</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now that would not have killed or gone near
killing an American born footman, if there is
such a thing as an American born footman.
He would have enjoyed it, just as his master
did; for that American, being very wealthy,
could if he liked have slept in the same bed
every night for a year, every night for many
years, until indeed the bed wore out. He preferred
to vary his beds as much as possible.
He had, no doubt, many beds which were in a
sense his own, beds in town houses, beds in
shooting boxes, beds in fishing lodges, beds in
<span class='pageno' title='246' id='Page_246'></span>
Europe, beds which he had bought with money
and to which he had an indefeasible title as
proprietor. But not one of these was, as an
Englishman would understand the words, his
own bed. There was not one to which he came
back after wandering as to a familiar resting
place. They were all just couches to sleep on,
to be occupied for a night or two, indistinguishable
from those which he hired in hotels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I am told that the English are learning the
habit of restlessness from the Americans, as
indeed they have learned many other things.
If they learn it thoroughly they will, I think,
have to give up the hope of being able to marry
wealthy American women. Their titles will
not purchase desirable brides for them if they
are no longer able to offer settled homes. According
to a very learned German historian, it
was the introduction of the "<span class='it'>stabilitas loci</span>"
ideal into the western rules which made monasticism
the popular career it was in the church.
It is his old fondness for settling down and
staying there which made the Englishman so
popular as a husband.
<span class='pageno' title='247' id='Page_247'></span></p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XI<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE OPEN DOOR</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Americans are forced by the restlessness of
their nature to move about frequently from
house to house, but they have arranged that
each temporary abode is very comfortable.
They are ahead of the English in their domestic
arrangements. I pay this tribute to them
very unwillingly, because I myself am more
at my ease in an inconveniently arranged
house. That is because I am accustomed to
inconvenience. The English houses are greatly
superior to the Irish, therefore to go straight
from an Irish house to an American, from
Connaught to Chicago, is to plunge oneself
too suddenly into strangely civilized surroundings.
I admire, but I fear it would be years
before I could enjoy, an American house. I
go to bed most contentedly in a bedroom in
<span class='pageno' title='248' id='Page_248'></span>
which a single candle lights a little circle round
it, leaving dim, fascinating spaces in which
anything may lurk. I like when the candle is
extinguished to see a faint glow of light from
a fire reflected on the ceiling. I find it pleasant
to remember, after I have got into bed,
that I do not know in what part of the room
I left the matches, that if I awake in the night
and want the light I must go on a dangerous
and exciting quest, feeling my way toward
the dressing table, sweeping one thing after
another off it while I pass my hand along in
search of the matchbox. The glare of the electric
light robs bed-going of its romance. The
convenient switch beside my hand cuts me off
from all chance of midnight adventure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I like to get out of bed on a frosty morning
and find myself in a thoroughly cold room.
The effort to do this very trying thing braces
me for the day. I slip a hand, an arm, a foot,
from the blankets, feel the nip of the air, draw
them back again, go through a period of intense
mental struggle, make a gallant effort,
fling all the bedclothes from me and stand
<span class='pageno' title='249' id='Page_249'></span>
shivering on the floor. I feel then that I am a
strong, virtuous man, fit to go forth and conquer.
The glow of righteousness becomes even
more delightful if I find a film of ice on the
water of my jug and break it with the handle
of a toothbrush. All this is denied me in an
American house. Getting out of bed there is
no real test of moral courage. The room is
pleasantly warm, a sponge is soft and pliable,
not a frozen stone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I like, where this is still possible, to have my
bath in a large tin dish, shallow and flat, which
stands in the middle of the bedroom floor with
a mat under it. There are fine old Irish houses
in which this delightful way of bathing still
survives. Alas! they are, even in Ireland, getting
fewer every day. The next best thing is
to wander down chilly corridors in search of
the single bathroom which the house contains.
This is, fortunately, still necessary in most
English and nearly all Irish houses. Any one
who is fond of the amusement of reading
house agents' advertisements must have noticed
the English economy in bathrooms.
<span class='pageno' title='250' id='Page_250'></span>
"Handsome mansion, four reception rooms,
lounge hall, billiard room, fifteen bedrooms,
bath, hot and cold." I do not believe that
there is a house like that in all America. Imagine
the excitement of living in it when all
the fifteen bedrooms are full. It stimulates
a man to feel, as he sallies forth with his towel
over his arm, that any one of the other fourteen
inhabitants may have reached the bath before
him, that thirteen people may possibly be
waiting in a queue outside the door. To get
into the bathroom in a house of that kind at the
first attempt must be like holding a hand at
bridge with four aces, four kings, four queens
and a knave in it, a thing worth living and
waiting for. In America all this is denied us.
A bathroom, luxuriously arranged, adjoins
each bedroom. Washing is made so ridiculously
easy that there ceases to be any virtue
in it. No one would say in America that
cleanliness is next to godliness. There is no
connection between the two things. It would
be as sensible to say that breathing is a subordinate
kind of virtue. In England a dressing
<span class='pageno' title='251' id='Page_251'></span>
gown is well-nigh a necessity. I know a
thoughtful host who provides one for his
guests; a warm voluminous garment in which
it is possible to go comfortably to the bathroom.
In America a dressing gown, for a
man, is a useless incumbrance. I dragged one
with me, but I shall never take it again; for,
like many other things, it is misnamed. It is
only when one has to stop dressing that a dressing
gown is any use.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In these matters of the heating of houses
and the arrangement of baths I prefer what
I am accustomed to, but I know that I am
little better than a barbarian. I might, if I
had lived in the days when matches were first
invented, have sighed for my flint and steel,
but I hope I should have recognized the superiority
of matches. I might, in the early days
of railways, have wished to go on traveling in
stage coaches, but I should have known that
steam engines are really better things than
horses at dragging heavy weights for long
distances. Thus I cling to the romance of icy
bedrooms and inconvenient baths, but I acknowledge
<span class='pageno' title='252' id='Page_252'></span>
freely that the Americans have
found the better way and made a step forward
along the road of human progress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I am not, however, so obstinately conservative
as to fail in appreciating some other points
in the American mastery of the domestic arts.
I may long for chilly rooms and remote baths,
but I thoroughly enjoy clean towels. Never
have I met so many clean towels as in America.
The English middle-class housekeeper is
behind her French sister in the provision of
towels, but the American is ahead even of
France. The American towel is indeed small,
the bath towel particularly small; but that
seems to me a trifling matter, hardly worth
mentioning, when the supply is abundant. I
would rather any day have three small apples
than one large one, and my feeling about towels
is the same. It is a real pleasure to find a
row of clean ones waiting every time it becomes
necessary to wash. It is certainly a mark of
superior civilization to realize the importance
of house linen in daily life. On the other
hand, it must be admitted that the American
<span class='pageno' title='253' id='Page_253'></span>
fails in the matter of sheets. What you get
are good, very good, smooth and cool. You
are constantly given clean ones. But they
are not long enough. In England the sheet on
your bed covers your feet completely and leaves
a broad flap at the other end which you can
turn over the blankets and tuck under your
chin. In America you must either leave your
feet sheetless or be content with a mere ribbon
of linen under your chin, a narrow strip which
will certainly wriggle away during the night.
This may not be the fault of the American
housekeeper. There may be some kind of linen
drapers' trust which baffles the efforts of reformers.
I have heard that in one of the
western states, where the suffrage has been
granted to women, a law has been passed that
all sheets must be made eighteen inches longer
than they usually are in the other American
states. That law is a strong proof of the advantages
to the community of allowing women
to vote. It also seems to show that the American
woman, at all events, is alive to the necessity
of reform in this matter of sheets, and is
<span class='pageno' title='254' id='Page_254'></span>
determined to do her best to remedy a defect
in her household management.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The disuse of doors in those parts of the
house which are inhabited during the daytime
is a very interesting feature of American domestic
life. The first action of an Englishman
when he enters a room is to shut the door. His
first duty when leaving it, if any one remains
inside, is to shut the door. No well-trained
servant ever leaves a door open unless specially
requested to do so. Children, from their very
earliest years, are taught to shut doors, and
punished—it is one of the few things for which
a child is systematically punished now—for
leaving doors open. An English mother calls
after her child as he leaves the room the single
word "door," or, if she is a very polite and
affectionate mother, two words, "door, dear,"
or "door, please." An American child would
not understand a request made in this elliptical
form. It knows of course what a door is, just
as it knows what a wall is, but it would be
puzzled by the mere utterance of the word,
just as an English child would be if its mother
<span class='pageno' title='255' id='Page_255'></span>
suddenly called to it, "wall," or "wall, dear,"
or "wall, please." The American child would
wonder what its mother wanted to say about
a door. The English child understands thoroughly
in the same way as we all understand
what a dentist means when he says, "Open,
please." It is never our favorite books, our
tightly clenched hands, or our screwed up eyes
which he wants us to open, always our mouths.
The word "open" is enough for us. So the
word "door" through a long association of
ideas at once suggests to the English child the
idea of shutting it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An Englishman is thoroughly uncomfortable
in a room with the door open. An American's
feeling about shut doors was very well
expressed to me by a lady who had been paying
a number of visits to friends in England.</p>

<p class='pindent'>"English houses," she said, "always seem to
me like hotels. When you go into them you
see nothing except shut doors."</p>

<p class='pindent'>If, after due apologies, you ask why Americans
have no doors between their sitting-rooms,
or why, when they have doors, they do
<span class='pageno' title='256' id='Page_256'></span>
not use them, you always get the same answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>"Doors," they say, "are necessary in England
to keep out draughts, because the English
do not know how to heat their houses. In
our houses all rooms and passages are kept
up to an even temperature and we do not require
doors."</p>

<p class='pindent'>This is an intelligible but not the real explanation
of this curious difference between
the Americans and the English. There are
some English homes which are centrally heated
and in which the temperature is as even, though
rarely as high, as in American houses; but the
Englishmen who live in them still shut doors.
An Englishman would shut the door of the
inner chamber of a Turkish bath if there were
a door to shut. In summer, when the days
are very warm, he opens all the windows he can,
but he does not sit with the door open. Temperature
has nothing to do with his fondness
for doors. In the same way there are in America
some houses which are not centrally heated,
very old-fashioned houses, but they are as
<span class='pageno' title='257' id='Page_257'></span>
doorless as the others. The fact seems to be
not that doors were disused when central heating
became common, but that central heating
was invented so that people who disliked doors
could be warm without them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I think the lady who told me that the English
houses seemed like hotels to her hinted
at the real explanation. The open door is a
symbol of hospitality. It is the expression of
sociability of disposition. The Americans are
hospitable and marvelously sociable. They
naturally like to live among open doors or with
no doors at all, so that any one can walk up
to him and speak to him without difficulty.
The Englishman, on the other hand, wants to
keep other people away from him, even members
of his own family. His dearest desire is
to have some room of his own into which he
can shut himself, where no one has a right to
intrude. He calls it his "den," which means
the lurking place of a morose and solitary animal.
Rabbits, which are sociable creatures,
live in burrows. Bees, which have perfected
the art of life in community, have hives. The
<span class='pageno' title='258' id='Page_258'></span>
bear has its den. Every room in an old-fashioned
English middle-class house is really
a den, though sometimes, as in the case of the
drawing-room, a den which is meant for the
use of several beasts of the same kind at once.
A change is indeed coming slowly over English
life in this matter. The introduction into
the middle classes of what is called by house
agents "the lounge hall" is a departure from
the "den" theory of domestic life. The "lounge
hall" is properly speaking a public room. It
is available at all hours of the day and no one
claims it specially as his own. It is accessible
at once to the stranger who comes into the
house from the street. It is still rare in England,
but where it exists it marks an approach
toward American ideals. The term "living-room"
only lately introduced by architects into
descriptions of English houses is another sign
that we are becoming more sociable than we
were. It is not simply another name for a
drawing-room. It stands for a new idea, an
American idea. The drawing-room—properly
the withdrawing-room—is for the use of people
<span class='pageno' title='259' id='Page_259'></span>
who want to escape temporarily from family
life. The living-room for those who live it
to the full.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the American house there are no "dens."
The American likes to feel that he is in direct
personal contact with the members of his family
and with his guest. It does not annoy him,
even if he happen to be reading a book on
economics, to feel that his wife may sit down
beside him or his daughter walk past the back
of his chair humming a tune without his having
had any warning that either of them was at
hand. The noise made by a servant collecting
knives and plates after dinner, reaching him
through a drawn curtain, does not disturb his
enjoyment of a cigar. The servant is to him
a fellow human being, and the sound of her
activities is a pleasant reminder of the comradeship
of man. He too has had his moments
of activity during the day. A guest in
an American house is for the time being a
member of the family, not a stranger who,
however welcome he may be, does not presume
to intrude upon his host's privacy.
<span class='pageno' title='260' id='Page_260'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The "porch," as it is called, a striking feature
of the American house, is another evidence
of the spirit of sociability. A "porch"
is a glorified and perfected veranda. In summer
it is a large open-air sitting-room. In
winter it can, by a common arrangement, be
made into a kind of sun parlor. It has its
roof, supported by wooden posts. When the
cold weather comes, frames, like very large
window sashes, are fitted between the posts
and a glass-sided room is made. It is evident
that the life in these porches is of a very public
kind. The passer-by, the casual wanderer
along the road outside, sees the American family
in its porch, can, if he cares to, note what
each member of the family is doing. The
American has no objection to this publicity.
He is not doing anything of which he is the
least ashamed. If other people can see him,
he can see them in return. The arrangement
gratifies his instinct for sociability. The Englishman,
on the other hand, hates to be seen.
Nothing would induce him to make a habit of
sitting in a veranda. Even in the depths of the
<span class='pageno' title='261' id='Page_261'></span>
country, when his house is a long way from
the road, he fits thin muslin curtains across the
lower part of his windows. These keep out a
good deal of light and in that way are annoying
to him, but he puts up with gloom rather
than run any risk, however small, that a
stranger, glancing through the window, might
actually see him. Yet the Englishman commonly
leads a blameless life in his own home.
He seldom employs his leisure in any shameful
practices. His casement curtains are
simply evidences of an almost morbid love of
privacy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first thing an Englishman does when
he builds a house is to surround it with a high
wall. This, indeed, is not an English peculiarity.
It prevails all over western Europe. It
is a most anti-social custom and ought to be
suppressed by law, because it robs many
people of a great deal of innocent pleasure.
The suburbs of Dublin, to take an example,
ought to be very beautiful. There are mountains
to the south and hills to the west and
north of the city, all of them lovely in outline
<span class='pageno' title='262' id='Page_262'></span>
and coloring. There is a wide and beautiful
bay on the east. But the casual wayfarer
cannot see either the mountains or the
bay. He must walk between high yellow
walls, walls built, I suppose, round houses; but
we can only know this by hearsay. For the
walls hide the houses as well as the view. In
Sorrento, which is even more exquisitely situated
than Dublin, you walk for miles and miles
between high walls, white in this case. The
only difference between the view you see at
Dublin and that which you see at Sorrento
is that the patch of sky you see in Dublin is
gray, at Sorrento generally blue. At Cintra,
one of the world's most famous beauty spots,
the walls are gray, and there you cannot even
see the sky, because the owners of the houses
inside the walls have planted trees and the
branches of the trees meet over the road. The
Americans do not build walls round their
houses. The humblest pedestrian, going afoot
through the suburbs of Philadelphia, Indianapolis
or any other city, sees not only the
<span class='pageno' title='263' id='Page_263'></span>
houses but anything in the way of a view which
lies beyond them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This is not because America is a republic
and therefore democratic in spirit. Portugal
is a republic too, having very vigorously got
rid of its king, but the walls of Cintra are as
high as ever. No one in the world is more
democratic than an English Liberal, but the
most uncompromising Liberals build walls
round their houses as high as those of any
Tory. The absence of walls in America is
simply another evidence of the wonderful sociability
of the people. Walls outside houses
are like doors inside. The European likes both
because the desire of privacy is in his blood.
The American likes neither.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The "Country Club" is an institution which
could flourish only among a very sociable
people. There are of course clubs of many
sorts in England. There is the club proper,
the club without qualification, which is found
at its very best in London. In books like
Whitaker's Almanac, which classify clubs, it
is described as "social," but this is only intended
<span class='pageno' title='264' id='Page_264'></span>
to distinguish it from political or sporting
clubs. There is no suggestion that it is
sociable, and in fact it is not. It is possible
to belong to a club in London for years without
knowing a dozen of your fellow members.
It often seems as if the members of these clubs
went to them mainly for the purpose of not
getting to know each other; a misfortune
which might happen to them anywhere else,
but from which they are secure in their clubs.
There are also all over England clubs specially
devoted to particular objects, golf clubs,
yacht clubs and so forth. In these the members
are drawn together by their interest in a
common pursuit, and are forced into some sort
of acquaintanceship. But these are very different
in spirit and intention from the American
Country Club. It exists as a kind of
center of the social life of the neighborhood.
There may be and often are golf links connected
with it. There are tennis courts, sometimes
swimming baths. There is always a ball-room.
There are luncheon rooms, tea rooms,
reading rooms. In connection with one such
<span class='pageno' title='265' id='Page_265'></span>
club which I saw there are sailing matches for a
one design class of boats. But neither golf
nor tennis, dancing nor sailing, is the object
of the club's existence. Sport is encouraged
by these clubs for the sake of general sociability.
In England sociability is a by-product
of an interest in sport.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Country Club at Tuxedo is not perhaps
the oldest, but it is one of the oldest institutions
of the kind in America. In connection
with it a man can enjoy almost any kind
of recreation from a Turkish bath to a game
of tennis, either the lawn or the far rarer original
kind. At the proper time of year there
are dances, and a débutante acquires, I believe,
a certain prestige by "coming out" at one
of them. But the club exists primarily as the
social center of Tuxedo. It is in one way
the ideal, the perfect country club. It not only
fosters, it regulates and governs the social life
of the place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tuxedo has been spoken of as a millionaire's
colony. It is a settlement, if not of millionaires,
at all events of wealthy people. The
<span class='pageno' title='266' id='Page_266'></span>
park, an immense tract of land, is owned by
the club. Ground for building can be obtained
only by those who are elected members of the
club and who are prepared to spend a certain
sum as a minimum on the building of their
houses. In theory the place is reserved for
people who either do or will know each other
socially, who are approximately on the same
level as regards wealth and who all want to
meet each other frequently, for one purpose
or another, in the club. In practice, certain
difficulties necessarily arise. A man may be
elected a member of the club and build a house.
He may be a thoroughly desirable person, but
in course of time he dies. His son may be
very undesirable, or his son may sell the house
to some one whom the club is not willing to admit
to membership. But Tuxedo society, instead
of becoming, as might have been expected,
a very narrow clique, seems to be singularly
broad minded and tolerant. The difficulty
of preserving the character of the place
and keeping a large society together as, in all
its essentials, a club, is very much less than
<span class='pageno' title='267' id='Page_267'></span>
might be expected. The place is extremely
interesting to any observer of American social
life. The club regulates everything. It runs
a private police force for the park. It keeps
up roads. It supplies electric light and, what
is hardly less necessary in America, ice to all
the houses. It levies, though I suppose without
any actual legal warrant, regular rates.
The fact that the experiment was not wrecked
long ago on the rocks of snobbery goes to
show that society in America is singularly fluid
compared to that of any European country.
That a considerable number of people should
want to live together in such a way is a witness
to the sociability of America. No other
country club has realized its ideal as the club
at Tuxedo has, but every country club—and
you find them all over America—has something
of the spirit of Tuxedo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tuxedo is immensely interesting in another
way. Nowhere else in the world, I suppose, is
it possible to see so many different kinds of
domestic architecture gathered together in a
comparatively small space. A walk round the
<span class='pageno' title='268' id='Page_268'></span>
shores of the lake gives you an opportunity of
seeing houses built in the dignified and spacious
colonial style, a happy modification of the
English Georgian. Beside one of these, close
to it, may be a house like that of a Mexican
rancher, and the hill behind is crowned with a
French château. There are houses which must
have had Italian models, others which suggest
memories of Tudor manor houses, others built
after the fashion of Queen Anne's time. There
are houses whose architects evidently had an
eclectic appreciation of all the houses built
anywhere or at any time, who had tried to embody
the most desirable features of very various
styles in one building. The general effect
of a view of Tuxedo is exceedingly bewildering
at first, but almost every house is the expression
of some individual tastes, either good
or bad. An architect may start, apparently
very often does start, with the idea of building
a house with twelve rooms in it at a cost of
four thousand pounds. Having thus settled
size and price, he may go ahead, trusting to
luck about the appearance. Or an architect
<span class='pageno' title='269' id='Page_269'></span>
may start with the idea of building a house in
a certain style, or to express some feeling, dignity,
homeliness, grandeur, or anything else.
The architects who built the Tuxedo houses all
seem to have gone to work on the latter plan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If the Tuxedo experiment in social life fails
and the club goes into liquidation, the United
States Government might do worse than buy
the whole place as it stands and turn it into a
college of domestic architecture. The students
could, without traveling more than a
mile or two, study every known kind of country
house. But, indeed, a college of this sort
seems less needed in America than anywhere
else. It is not only the insides of the houses
which are well planned. The outsides of the
newer houses are for the most part beautiful
to look at. And one can see them, there being
no walls.

<div><h1>CHAPTER XII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>COLLEGES AND STUDENTS</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The municipal elections in New York which
resulted in the defeat of Tammany were
fought out with great vigor in all the usual
ways. There were speeches, bands and flags.
The newspapers were full of the sayings of
the different candidates, and the leader writers
of each party seemed to be highly successful
in cornering the speakers of the other party.
It was shown clearly every day that orators
shamelessly contradicted themselves, went back
on their own principles, and must, if they had
any respect for logic or decency, either retract
their latest remarks or explain them. All this
was very interesting to us. It would have been
interesting to any one. It was particularly
interesting to us because it was almost new to
us. Elections are, I suppose, fought in more
<span class='pageno' title='271' id='Page_271'></span>
or less the same way everywhere; but in Connaught
we hardly ever have elections. An independent
candidate bubbles up occasionally,
but as a rule we are content to return to Parliament
the proper man, that is to say the
man whom somebody, we never quite know
who, says we ought to return.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I gathered the impression that elections must
be an exciting sport for those engaged in them.
I do not think that the "pomp and circumstance"
of the business, the outward manifestations
of activity, can make much difference
to the result. Speeches, for instance, are certainly
thrilling things to make, and I can understand
how it is that orators welcome elections
as heaven sent opportunities for the exercise
of their art. But the people who listen
to the speeches always seem to have their minds
made up beforehand whether they agree with
the speaker or not. They know what he is
going to say and are prepared with hoots or
cheers. I never heard of any one who came to
hoot remaining to cheer. I doubt whether
there is a single modern instance of a speech
<span class='pageno' title='272' id='Page_272'></span>
having affected the destiny of a vote. A very
good speech might indeed produce some effect
if it were not that there is always an equally
good speech made at the same time on the other
side. Election speeches are like tug boats pulling
different ways at the opposite ends of a
large ship. They neutralize each other and
the ship drifts gently, sideways, with the tide.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It cannot be seriously maintained that bands
or flags help voters to make up their minds.
In nine cases out of ten it is impossible to tell
for which side a band is playing, and therefore
unlikely that it will draw voters to one
side rather than the other. In the tenth case,
when the band, by selecting some particular
tune, makes its meaning clear, the music is not
of a quality which moves the listener to any
feeling of gratitude to the candidate who pays
for it. I should, I think, feel bound to vote
for a man who gave me "<span class='it'>panem et circenses</span>,"
but I should expect good bread and an attractive
circus. I should not dream of voting for
a candidate who provided me with inferior
music. The flags are a real addition to the
<span class='pageno' title='273' id='Page_273'></span>
gaiety of city life. The ordinary elector loves
to see them fluttering about. But the ordinary
elector is not by any means a fool. He knows
that the flags will be taken down very soon
after the election is over. If any candidate
promised to keep his flags flying as a permanent
decoration of the city streets he might
capture a few votes. But we all know that
none of them will do anything as useful as
that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor do I think that the editors of newspapers
produce much effect by showing up
the inconsistencies of politicians and pinning
them down to-day, when they are driven to
say something quite different, to the things
which, under stress of other circumstances,
they said yesterday. It does not take a clever
man, like a newspaper editor, to corner a politician.
Any fool can do that, and the performance
of an obviously easy trick does not
move an audience at all. An acrobat who
merely hops across the stage on one leg gets
no applause and the box office returns fall
away. The thing is too easy. It is the man
<span class='pageno' title='274' id='Page_274'></span>
who does something really hard, balances himself
on the end of an umbrella and juggles
with twenty balls at once, who attracts the
public. If a newspaper editor at an election
time would, instead of showing up the other
side, offer proofs that the men on his own
side are consistent, logical and high-principled,
he would have enormous influence with the voters.
"Any one," so the ordinary man would
reason, "who can prove things like that about
politicians must be amazingly clever. If he is
amazingly clever, far cleverer than I ever hope
to be, then there is a strong probability that
his side is the right one. I shall vote for it."
The ordinary man, so we ought to recollect, is
not nearly such a fool as is generally supposed.
He is quite capable of reasoning, and he would
reason, I am sure, just in the way I have suggested,
if he were given a chance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The keen interest which we took in the
showy side of electioneering made us diligent
readers of the newspapers. We were rewarded
beyond our hopes. We came across, on the
very evening of the election itself, a little paragraph,
<span class='pageno' title='275' id='Page_275'></span>
tucked away in a corner, which we
might very easily have missed if we had been
less earnest students. In a certain district in
New York, so this paragraph told us, there
was a queue of voters waiting outside a polling
station. Among them was a man who was
known to be or was suspected of being hostile
to Tammany. It was likely that he would cast
his vote on the other side. There were, looking
thoughtfully at the queue, certain men
described by the newspaper as "gangsters" in
the pay of the Tammany organization. They
seized the voter whose principles seemed to
them objectionable and dragged him out of
the queue, plainly in order to prevent his recording
his vote. So far there was nothing of
very special interest in the paragraph. We
knew beforehand—even in Ireland we know
this—that voters are a good deal influenced
by the strength of the party machine. The
strength is seldom displayed in its nakedly
physical form on this side of the Atlantic, but
it is always there and is really the determining
force in most elections. It was the thing which
<span class='pageno' title='276' id='Page_276'></span>
happened next which gave the incident its
value. A university student who happened to
be engaged in social work in the neighborhood
saw what was done. He was one man and
there were several "gangsters," but he attacked
them at once. He was, as might be supposed,
as he himself must surely have foreseen,
worsted in the fray which followed. The
gangsters, after the manner of their kind,
mauled, beat and kicked him to such an extent
that he had to be carried to a hospital. It did
not appear that this university student was a
party man, eager for the triumph of his side
as the gangsters were for the victory of theirs.
He seems to have acted on the simple principle
that a man who has a right to vote ought not
to be interfered with in the exercise of that
right. He was on the side of justice and liberty.
He was not concerned with politics of
either kind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I do not know what happened to that student
afterwards. I searched the papers in
vain for any further reference to the incident.
I wanted to know whether the voter voted in
<span class='pageno' title='277' id='Page_277'></span>
the end. I wanted to know what was done to
the gangsters. I wanted to know whether the
student recovered from his injuries or not. I
wanted, above all, to know whether anyone
recognized how fine a thing that student did.
I never discovered another paragraph about
the incident.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was talking some time afterwards to an
English friend, the friend to whom I have already
referred, who knows America very well
and who offered to take care of me while I was
there. I told him the story of the voter and
the Tammany gangsters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>"These things," he said, "happen over here.
They are constantly happening. One gets into
the way of not being shocked by them. But
there always is that university student somewhere
round, when they do happen."</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is an amazingly high tribute to the American
universities. If my friend is right, if
blatant force and abominable injustice do indeed
find themselves faced, always and as a
matter of course, by a university student, then
the universities are doing a very splendid work.
<span class='pageno' title='278' id='Page_278'></span>
And I am inclined to think that my friend is
right. There is another story of the same
kind, one of many which might be told. This
one came to me, not in a newspaper but from
the lips of a man who told me that he was a
witness of what happened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was—I forget where—a kind of settlement,
half camp, half town, built in a lonely
place for the workmen of a company which
was conducting some mining or engineering
enterprise. The town, if I am to call it a
town, was owned and ruled by the company.
The workmen were of various nationalities,
and, taken as a whole, a rough lot. It was, no
doubt, difficult to keep them contented, difficult
enough to keep them at all in such a place.
It would probably be unjust to say that the
company encouraged immorality; but the existence
of disorderly houses in the place was
winked at. The men wanted them. The officials
of the company, we may suppose, found
their line of least resistance in ignoring an evil
which they may have felt they could not cure.
After a while, during one summer vacation,
<span class='pageno' title='279' id='Page_279'></span>
there came to the place a university student.
He was not a miner or an engineer and had no
particular business with the company. He
was, apparently, on a kind of mission; but
whether he was preaching Christianity or social
reform of a general kind I was not told. He
was the inevitable university student of my
friend's remark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He found himself face to face with an evil
thing which he at all events would not ignore.
He made his protest. Now no man of the
world, certainly no business man, objects to a
proper protest, temperately made, provided the
protester does not go too far. The man of the
world is tolerant. He is a consistent believer
in the policy of living and letting live. He
recognizes that people with principles must be
allowed to state them. It is in order to be
stated that principles exist. But he holds that
in common fairness he ought to be allowed to
ignore these statements of principle. That
was just what this university student could not
understand. He went on protesting more and
more forcibly until he made the officials uncomfortable
<span class='pageno' title='280' id='Page_280'></span>
and the men exceedingly angry.
It was the men, either with, or, as I hope, without
the knowledge of their superiors, who first
threatened, then beat that university student,
beat him on the head with a sandbag and finally
drove him from the place with a warning that
he had better not return again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did return, bringing with him certain
officers of the law. He was a man of some
strength of character and the recollection of
the beating did not cause him to hesitate. Unfortunately
the officers of the law could not
do much. The disorderly houses were all quite
orderly when they appeared. They were small
shops selling apples, matches and other innocent
things. There was no evidence to be got
that anything worse had ever gone on in them
than the sale of apples and matches. The
previous inhabitants of these houses were picnicking
in the woods for a few days. All that
the officers of the law were able to do was to
conduct the university student safely out of the
place. That was difficult enough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I am not sure that this story is true, for I
<span class='pageno' title='281' id='Page_281'></span>
did not read it in a newspaper; but it is very
like several others which I heard. They may
all be false or very greatly exaggerated, but
they show, at least, the existence of a popular
myth in which the university student figures,
always with the same kind of character. Behind
every myth there is some reality. Even
solar myths, the vaguest myths there are, lead
back ultimately to the sun, which is indubitably
there. It seems to me that whether he
actually does these fine things or not the American
university student has succeeded in impressing
the public with the idea that he is the
kind of man who might do them. That in itself
is no small achievement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I wanted very much, because of the myth
and for other reasons, to see something of
American university life. I did see something,
a little of it, both at Yale and Princeton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have heard it said that the Englishman is
more attached to his school than to his university,
that in after life he will think of himself
as belonging to Eton, to Harrow, to Winchester,
rather than to Oxford or to Cambridge.
<span class='pageno' title='282' id='Page_282'></span>
The school, for some reason, rather than the
university, is regarded as "the mother" from
whom the life of the man's soul flowed, to
whom his affection turns. An Oxford man or
a Cambridge man is indeed all his life long
proud, as he very well may be, of his connection
with his university, but his school is the
subject of his deepest feeling. Round it
rather than the university gathers that emotion
which for want of better words may be described
as educational patriotism. An Irishman,
on the other hand, if he is a graduate of
Dublin University, thinks more of "Trinity"
than he does of his school. He may have been
at one of the most famous English public
schools, but his university, to a considerable
extent, obliterates the memories of it. He
thinks of himself through life as a T. C. D.
man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>America is like Ireland in this respect. I
find, looking back on my memories of the
American men whom I met most frequently,
that I know about several of them whether they
are Yale men, Princeton men or Harvard men.
<span class='pageno' title='283' id='Page_283'></span>
I do not know about any single one of them
what school they belonged to. I never asked
any questions on the subject. Such information
as I got came to me accidentally. It came
to me without my knowing that I was getting
it. Only afterwards did I realize that I knew
A. to be a Yale man, B. to be a Harvard man
and so forth. In England the information
which comes unsought about a man concerns
his school rather than his university. It is the
name of his school which drops from his lips
when he begins talking about old days. There
are oftener books about his school than about
his university on his shelves, photographs of
his school on the walls of his study.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I do not know that there is in the American
universities any definitely planned and deliberate
effort to create or foster this spirit of
patriotism. There is certainly no such effort
apparent in Dublin University. The spirit is
there. That is all that can be said. It pervades
these institutions. Only an occasional and
more or less eccentric undergraduate escapes
its influence.
<span class='pageno' title='284' id='Page_284'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The patriotism is indeed much more obvious
and vocal in America than in Dublin. We had
the good luck to be present at a football match
between Yale and Colgate Universities. It
was not a match of first-rate importance, but
an enormous crowd of spectators gathered to
witness it. The excitement of the supporters
of both sides was intense. There was no possible
mistake about the fact that professors
and undergraduates, old men who had graduated
long ago and boys who were not yet
undergraduates, wives, mothers and sisters of
graduates and undergraduates, were all eagerly
anxious about the result of the game. Yale,
in the end, was quite unexpectedly beaten. It
is not too much to say that a certain gloom was
distinctly noticeable afterward everywhere in
New Haven. It hung over people who were
not specially interested in athletics of any kind.
It affected the spirits of my host's parlormaid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Very shortly after my return home I
watched a football match between Dublin University
and Oxford. The play was just as
keen and sportsmanlike as the play between
<span class='pageno' title='285' id='Page_285'></span>
Yale and Colgate; but there was nothing like
the same general interest in the game. There
was a sprinkling of spectators round the
ground, an audience which could not compare
in size with that of Yale. They were interested
in the game, intelligently interested. They
applauded good play when they saw it; but
there was nothing to correspond to the tense
excitement which we witnessed in America.
The game was a game. If Dublin won, well
and good. If Oxford won, then Dublin must
try to do better next time. No one feared defeat
as a disaster. No one was prepared to
hail victory with wild enthusiasm. A stranger
could not have gone through New Haven on
the day of the Yale and Colgate football match
without being aware that something of great
importance was happening. The whole town
seemed to be streaming toward the football
ground. In Dublin you might have walked
not only through the city but through most
parts of the college itself on the day of the
match against Oxford and you would not have
discovered, unless you went into the park, that
<span class='pageno' title='286' id='Page_286'></span>
there was a football match. Yet the pride of
a Dublin man in his university is as deep and
lasting as that of any American.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The reason of the difference is perhaps to
be found in the fact that everything connected
with university athletics is far more highly organized
in America than on this side of the
Atlantic. The undergraduate spectators are
drilled to shout together. They practice beforehand
songs which they sing on the occasion
of the match for the encouragement of their
own side. Young men with megaphones stand
in front of closely packed rows of undergraduates.
They give the signal for shouting.
With wavings of their arms they conduct the
yells of the crowd as musicians conduct their
orchestras. The result is something as different
as possible from the casual, accidental applause
of our spectators. It is the difference
between a winter rainstorm and the shower of
an April morning. This organized enthusiasm
affects everyone present. Sober-looking men
and women shout and wave little flags tumultuously.
They cannot help themselves. I understood,
<span class='pageno' title='287' id='Page_287'></span>
after seeing that football match, why
it is that America produces more successful
religious revivalists than England does. The
Americans realize that emotion is highly infectious.
They have mastered the art of spreading
it. I do not know whether this is a useful
art or not. It probably is, if the emotion is
a genuine and worthy one; but it is not pleasant
to think that one might be swept away,
temporarily intoxicated, by the skill of some
organizer who is engaged in propagating a
morbid enthusiasm. However that may be,
love for a university is a thoroughly healthy
thing. It cannot be wrong to foster it by
songs and shouts or even—a curious reversion
to the totem religion of our remote ancestors—by
identifying oneself with a bulldog or a
tiger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I met one evening some young men who had
graduated in Trinity College, Dublin, and
afterwards gone over for a post-graduate
course to a theological college connected with
one of the American universities. We talked
<span class='pageno' title='288' id='Page_288'></span>
about Dublin chiefly, but I made one inquiry
from them about their American experience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>"I suppose," I said, "that you have to work
a great deal harder here than you did at
home?"</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their answer was given with smiling assurance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>"Oh, dear no; nothing like so hard."</p>

<p class='pindent'>I should like very much to have further reliable
information on this point. Something
might be got, perhaps, by consulting a number
of Rhodes scholars at Oxford. My impression,
a vague one, is that the ordinary undistinguished
American undergraduate is not required
to work so hard as an undergraduate of
the same kind is in England or Ireland. In an
American magazine devoted to education I
came across an article which complained that, in
the matter of what may be called examination
knowledge, the American undergraduate is not
the equal of the English undergraduate. He
does not know as much when he enters the university
and he does not know as much when he
leaves it. This was an American opinion. It
<span class='pageno' title='289' id='Page_289'></span>
would be very interesting to have it confirmed
or refuted. But no one, on either side of the
Atlantic, supposes that the kind of knowledge
which is useful in examinations is of the first
importance. The value of a university does
not depend upon the number of facts which
it can drive into the heads of average men;
but on whether it can, by means of its teaching
and its atmosphere, get the average man into
the habit of thinking nobly, largely and sanely.
It seems certain that the American university
training does have a permanent effect on the
men who go through it, an effect like that produced
by English schools, and certainly also by
English universities, on their students. A man
who is, throughout life, loyal to his school or
university has not passed through it uninfluenced.
It seems likely that the American universities
are succeeding in turning out very
good citizens. The existence of what I have
called the university student myth, the existence
of a general opinion that university men
are likely to be found on the side of civic righteousness,
<span class='pageno' title='290' id='Page_290'></span>
is a witness to the fact that the universities
are doing their main work well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little, the very little I was able to see
of university life helped me to understand how
the work is being done. The chapel services,
on weekdays and Sundays, were in many ways
strange to me and I cannot imagine that I,
trained in other rituals, would find digestible
the bread of life which they provide. But I
was profoundly impressed by the reality of
them. Here was no official tribute to a God
conceived of as a constitutional monarch to
whom respect and loyalty is due but whose will
is of no very great importance, a tribute saved
perhaps from formality by the mystic devotion
of a few; but an effort, groping and tentative
no doubt, to get into actual personal touch with
a divinity conceived of as not far remote from
common life. These chapel services—exercises
is the better word for them—can hardly fail to
have a profound effect upon the ordinary man.
I have stood in the chapel of Oriel College at
Oxford and felt that now and then men of
the finer kind, worshiping amid the austere
<span class='pageno' title='291' id='Page_291'></span>
dignity of the place, might grow to be saints,
might see with their eyes and handle with their
hands the mysterious Word of Life. I sat in
the chapel at Princeton, I listened to a sermon
at Yale, and felt that men of commoner clay
might go out from them to face a battering
from the fists and boots of Tammany gangsters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It seems to me significant that Americans
have not got the words "don" and "donnish."
They are terms of reproach in England, but
the very fact that they are in use proves that
they are required. They describe what exists.
The Americans have no use for the words because
they have not got the man or the quality
which they name. The teaching staffs of the
American universities do not develop the qualities
of the don. They do not tend to become a
class apart with a special outlook upon life. It
is possible to meet a professor—even a professor
of English literature—in ordinary society,
to talk to him, to be intimate with him and not
to discover that he is a professor. Charles
Lamb maintained that school-mastering left an
<span class='pageno' title='292' id='Page_292'></span>
indelible mark upon a man, that having school-mastered
he never afterward was quite the
same as other men. I had a friend once who
boasted that he could "spot" a parson however
he was dressed, had spotted parsons who were
not dressed at all—in Turkish baths. I do not
believe that the most careful student of professional
mannerisms could detect an American
professor out of his lecture room. It is
possible that this note of ordinary worldliness
in the members of the staff of the American
university has a beneficial effect upon the students.
It may help to suggest the thought that
a university course is no more than a preparation
for life, is not, as most of us thought once,
a thing complete in itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In all good universities there is a broad
democratic spirit among the undergraduates.
They may, and sometimes do, despise the students
of other universities as men of inferior
class, but they only despise those of their fellow
students in their own university who,
according to the peculiar standards of youth,
deserve contempt. In American universities
<span class='pageno' title='293' id='Page_293'></span>
this democratic spirit is stronger than it is with
us because there is greater opportunity for its
development. There are wider differences of
wealth—it is difficult to speak of class in
America—among the university students there
than here. There are no men in English or
Irish universities earning their keep by cleaning
the boots and pressing the clothes of their
better-endowed fellow students. In American
universities there are such men and it is quite
possible that one of them may be president of
an important club, or captain of a team, elected
to these posts by the very men whose boots he
cleans. If he is fit for such honors they will be
given him. The fact that he cleans boots will
not stand in his way. The wisdom of medieval
schoolmen made room in universities for
poor students, sizars, servitors. The American
universities, with their committees of employment
for students who want to earn, are doing
the old thing in a new way; and public opinion
among the graduates themselves approves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the subject of the higher university
education of girls American opinion is sharply
<span class='pageno' title='294' id='Page_294'></span>
divided. There are people there, just as there
are in England, who say that the whole thing
is a mistake, that it is better for girls not to go
to college on any terms, under any system. I
suppose that we must call these people reactionary.
There cannot be very many of them
anywhere. It was a surprise to me to find
any at all in America. They are not, I think,
very influential. Among those who favor the
higher education of girls there are many who
believe whole-heartedly in co-education. I had
no opportunity of seeing a co-educational college,
but I listened to a detailed description of
the life in one from a lady who had lived it.
According to her co-education is the one perfect
system yet hit upon. Its critics urge two
curiously inconsistent objections to it. One
man, who is a philosopher and also seemed to
know what he was talking about, told me that
boys and girls educated together lose the sense
of sex mystery, which lies at the base of romantic
love and consequently do not want to
marry. According to his theory, based upon
a careful observation of facts, the students of
<span class='pageno' title='295' id='Page_295'></span>
co-educational universities never fall in love
with each other or with anyone else. If the
system were widely adopted and had this effect
upon the students everywhere, the results
would certainly be very unfortunate. Another
critic, equally well informed, said that the real
objection to co-education is that the students
do little else except fall in love with each other.
This, though no doubt educative in a broad
sense of the word, is not exactly the kind of
education we send boys and girls to universities
to get. It must be very gratifying to the
friends of the system to feel that these two objections
cannot both be sound.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Co-educational colleges are chiefly to be
found in the West, among the newer states. In
the East girls get their higher education for
the most part in colleges of their own. Smith
College for instance has no connection with
any of the men's universities. Nor has Vassar
nor Bryn Mawr. These institutions have their
own staffs, their own courses and examinations,
their own rules, and confer their own degrees.
Barnard College, on the other hand, is closely
<span class='pageno' title='296' id='Page_296'></span>
connected with Columbia University, occupying
much the same position as Girton and St.
Margaret's Hall do with regard to Cambridge
and Oxford, scarcely as intimately joined to
Columbia as Trinity Hall is to Dublin University.
I had the opportunity of learning
something of the life of Smith College. I was
immensely impressed by the spirit of the place,
as indeed I was by that of all the girls' schools
and colleges which I saw. There was an infectious
kind of eagerness about both pupils
and teachers. There is a feeling of hopefulness.
It is as if life were looked upon as a
great and joyful adventure in which many discoveries
of good things may be expected, much
strenuous work may be done gladly, in which
no disillusion waits for those who are of good
heart. Not the girls alone, but those who teach
and guide them, are young, young in the way
which defies the passing of years to make them
old. We are not young because we have seen
eighteen summers and no more, or old, because
we have seen eighty. We are old when we have
shut the doors of our hearts against the desire
<span class='pageno' title='297' id='Page_297'></span>
of new things and steeled ourselves against
the hope of good. We are young if we refuse,
even when our heads are gray, to believe
that disappointment inevitably waits for us.
The world and everything in it belongs to the
young. It is this pervading sense of youthfulness
which makes the American girls' colleges
so fascinating to a stranger. It is not difficult
to believe that the girls who come out of
them are able to take their places by the side
of men in business life, or if the commoner
and happier lot waits them, are well fitted to be
the partners of men who do great things and
the mothers of men who will do greater things
still.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I take it that the American universities, both
those for men and women, are the greatest
things in America to-day. This, curiously
enough, is not the American idea. The ordinary
American citizen is proud of every single
thing in his country except his universities.
He is always a little apologetic about them.
He compares his country with England and is
convinced that America is superior in every
<span class='pageno' title='298' id='Page_298'></span>
respect, except the matter of universities.
When he speaks of the English universities
he shows a certain sense of reverence and makes
mention of his own much in the spirit of
Touchstone who introduced Audrey as "a poor
thing, but my own."
<span class='pageno' title='299' id='Page_299'></span></p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XIII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE IRISHMAN ABROAD</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The educated American seems to have a
great deal of affection for Ireland, but is not
over fond of Irishmen. Our country, considered
as an Island situated on the far side of
the Atlantic, makes a strong appeal to him.
It is a land of thousand wrongs, a pitiful
waif on the hard highway of the world. It
smells strongly of poetry and music in a minor
key, and the American is, like all good business
men, an incurable sentimentalist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is always pleasant to be loved and it is
nice to feel that America has this affection for
our poor, lost land. But the love would
gratify us much more than it does if there
were a little less pity mixed up in it, and if it
were not taken for granted that we all write
poetry. I remember meeting an American
<span class='pageno' title='300' id='Page_300'></span>
lady who was quite lyrical in her appreciation
of Ireland. She had penetrated into the country
as far as Avoca, making the trip from
Dublin in a motor car. She stayed, so she told
me, "in a dear old-fashioned inn in Dublin."
She had forgotten its name, but described its
situation to me very accurately. I could not
possibly make a mistake about it. My heart
was hot within me when I suggested that it
might have been the Shelbourne Hotel at
which she stayed. Her face lit up with a
gleam of recognition of the name.</p>

<p class='pindent'>"Yes," she said, "that's it, such a sweet old
place; just Ireland all over, and really quite
comfortable when you get used to it."</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now the Shelbourne Hotel is our idea of a
thoroughly up-to-date, cosmopolitan caravanserai.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even after a visit to America and a considerable
experience of American hotels, I cannot
think of the Shelbourne Hotel as an inn, as
old-fashioned, or as in any way Irish except
through the accident of its situation. It evidently
suggests to the American mind tender
<span class='pageno' title='301' id='Page_301'></span>
thoughts of Mr. Yeats' "small cabin, of mud
and wattles made" on Inishfree. It suggests
no such thoughts to us. Dinner at the Shelbourne
Hotel costs five shillings, nothing to an
American, of course, but a heavy price to us
in Ireland. It consists of several courses and
we think it quite a grand dinner. It seems to
the American that he is at last reduced to the
traditional Irish diet of potatoes and potheen
whiskey. It is this way of thinking about Ireland
which takes the sweetness out of the
American's genuine affection for our country.
We do not mind admitting that we are half a
century behind America in every respect, but
we like to think that we are making some progress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An American's eyes soften when you talk to
him about Ireland, and you feel that at any
moment he may say "dear land," so deep is his
sentimental pity and affection for our country.
But his eyes harden when you mention Irishmen
and you feel that at any moment he may
say something very nasty about them. The
plain fact is that Irishmen are not very popular
<span class='pageno' title='302' id='Page_302'></span>
in America. We have, it appears, managed
the American's municipal politics for him in
several of his principal cities and he does not
like it. But I am not sure that his resentment
is quite just. Somebody must manage municipal
politics everywhere. For a good many
years the American would not manage them
himself. He was too busy making money to
bother himself about municipal politics. We
took over the job—at a price. He paid the
price with a shrug of the shoulders. I cannot
see that he has much to complain about. Lately
he has kicked—not against the size of the price—it
is not the American way to higgle about
money—but against there being any price at
all. He has got it into his head that municipal
politics ought to be run "free gratis and for
nothing" by high-souled patriotic men. I sincerely
hope that he will realize his ideal, though
I doubt whether any politics anywhere can be
run in that way. It will certainly be better for
my fellow countrymen to earn their bread in
any way rather than by politics. But there is,
no sense in being angry with us or abusing us.
<span class='pageno' title='303' id='Page_303'></span>
We worked the machine and took our wages.
The American watched the machine running
and paid the wages. There was not much to
choose between him and us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is another reason why we are not as
popular as we might be—as, no doubt, we
ought to be—in America. We have remained
Irish. One of the most wonderful things about
America is its power of absorbing people. Men
and women flow into it from all corners of the
world, and in a very short time, in a couple of
generations, become American. I have seen it
stated that the very shapes of the skulls of immigrants
alter in America; that the son of an
Italian man has an American not an Italian
skull, even if his mother also came from Italy.
Whether this change really takes place in the
bones of immigrants I do not know. Quite as
surprising a change certainly does take place in
their nature. They cease to be foreigners and
become American. But the Irish have never
been thoroughly Americanized. Their American
citizenship becomes a great and dear thing
to them, but they are still in some sense citizens
<span class='pageno' title='304' id='Page_304'></span>
of Ireland. If a question ever arose in which
American interests clashed with Irish interests
there might well be a solid Irish vote in favor
of sacrificing America to Ireland. The Irish
are a partial exception to the rule that America
absorbs its immigrants. It has not thoroughly
absorbed us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This is the shape which the Irish problem
has assumed in America. Here at home the
question is, is England to govern Irishmen?
It has obviously failed to make Englishmen
of us. On the other side of the Atlantic the
question is: Are Irishmen to govern America?
America has not succeeded in making Americans
of all of us so far.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So far. But the position of Irishmen in
America is changing. There was a time when
we took our place in the American social order
as hewers of wood and drawers of water. We
were the navvies, the laborers, the men who
handled the pickaxe and spade. Now it is men
of other races who do this work—Italians and
Slavs. We have risen in the scale. The Irish
emigrant who lands in New York to-day starts
<span class='pageno' title='305' id='Page_305'></span>
higher up than the Irish emigrant of twenty-five
years ago. So long as we were at the bottom
of the social scale we were bound together
by a community of interest and outlook as
well as by nationality. We were easily organized
as a voting unit. But men, as they rise
in the world, tend more and more to become individuals.
They have differing interests. They
look at things in different ways. They are far
more difficult to organize. The sense of original
nationality will remain to us, no doubt, as
it remains among Americans of Scottish descent.
But it may cease to be an effective political
force.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Ulster Irishman went to America in
large numbers before there was any great immigration
of southern and western Irishmen.
He fought his way up in the social scale very
quickly and became thoroughly Americanized.
He has had a profound influence on American
civilization and character. It has been the influence
of digested food, not the force exercised
by a lump of dough swallowed hastily. But in
time even a lump of dough is digested by a
<span class='pageno' title='306' id='Page_306'></span>
healthy stomach and the gradual rise of the
Irish in the social life of America looks like
the beginning of the process of digestion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is something else besides the change in
his social position which will in time make it
easier for America to absorb thoroughly the
Irish immigrant. The Irish who went to
America during the last half of the 19th century
left their homes with a sense in them of
burning wrong. They were men who hated.
They hated England and all in Irish life which
stood for England. This hate bound them together.
Irish political struggles, whether of
the Fenian or the Parnell type, appealed to
them. Ireland was, in one way or the other,
up against England. But all this has changed.
Irish politicians are no longer engaged in a
struggle with England. They are in alliance
with one set of Englishmen and only against
another set of Englishmen. There is in Irish
politics at home an appeal to the man of party
feeling. He is keen enough for his own party,
keen enough against the other party, but when
he gets to America neither of the parties at
<span class='pageno' title='307' id='Page_307'></span>
home can move him to any special enthusiasm.
He no longer, when at home, hates England.
He hates, if hate is not too strong a word, some
Englishmen. There is a great difference between
hating England and hating some Englishmen,
when you are so far away that all
Englishmen get blurred. It is easy in Ireland
to feel that Codlin is the friend, not Short.
It is not so easy to distinguish Codlin from
Short, Liberal from Conservative, when they
are both no more than little dots, barely visible
at a distance of three thousand miles. Codlin
gets mixed up with Short. Some of the original
party hatred of Short attaches to Codlin,
no doubt. But some of the love for Codlin,
love which is the fruit of long alliance, passes
to Short.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I do not mean to suggest that the sense of
nationality has passed away from Ireland. It
has not. In some ways the spirit of nationality
is stronger in Ireland to-day than it was
at any time during the last century. It has
certainly penetrated to classes which used to
have no consciousness of nationality at all.
<span class='pageno' title='308' id='Page_308'></span>
There are fewer Irishmen now who are ashamed
of being Irish. There are more men now than
ever, in every class, who want the good of Ireland
as distinguished from that of England
or of any other country. But the sense of nationality
has to a very large extent passed out
of Irish political life. The platform appeal
of the politician to the voter in Ireland now
is far oftener an appeal to Irishmen as part
of the British democracy than to Irishmen
as members of a nation governed against its
will by foreigners. The ideas of John
O'Leary, even the ideas of Parnell, have almost
vanished from Irish political life. Instead
of them we have the idea of international
democracy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This change of feeling in Ireland itself will
make for a modification of the position of the
Irish in America. They will tend, as the older
generation passes, to become more American
and less Irish. This is already felt in Ireland
itself. Of late years there has arisen a
strong feeling against emigration. It is realized,
as it used not to be, that Ireland loses
<span class='pageno' title='309' id='Page_309'></span>
those who go. The feeling is quite new. The
phrase "a greater Ireland beyond the seas" is
beginning to mean a little less than it did, and
the general consciousness of patriotic Irishmen
at home is instinctively recognizing this.
But it is noticeable that this dislike of emigration
has not found expression among politicians.
The movement is outside politics. The
local political boss is frequently an emigration
agent and feels no inconsistency in his position.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It would be quite easy to exaggerate the
present value of the change I have tried to indicate.
The old solidarity of the Irish in
America remains a fact. It is to Irish friends
and relatives that our emigrants go. It is
among Irish people that they live when they
settle in America. It is Irish people whom
they marry. But the tendency is toward a
breaking away from this national isolation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The movement against emigration at home
has much in it besides the instinctive protest
of a nation against the loss of its people. It is
in part religious and rests on a fear that faith
<span class='pageno' title='310' id='Page_310'></span>
is more easily lost in America than in Ireland.
It is in part no doubt the result of shrinking
of sensitive and loving souls from the horror
of the great sorrow of farewell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All emotions lose their keenness with repetition.
The fine rapture of a joy is never quite so
delightful as it was when the joy came first and
was strange. The bitterness of sorrow and disappointment
gradually loses its intensity when
sorrow and disappointment become familiar
things. Even insults cease after a while to move
us to fierce anger. The law is universal; but
there are some emotions which are only very
slowly dulled. The sadness which comes of
watching the departure of a train full of Irish
emigrants is one of these. We are, or ought to
be, well accustomed to the sight. Those of us
who have lived long in the country parts of
Ireland have seen these trains and traveled a
little way in them many times; but we are still
saddened, hardly less saddened than when we
saw them first.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is one day in the week on which emigrants
go, and in the west of Ireland one train
<span class='pageno' title='311' id='Page_311'></span>
on that day by which they travel. It goes
slowly, stopping at every station no matter
how small, and at every station there is the
same scene. The platform is crowded long before
the train comes in. There are many old
women weeping without restraint, mothers
these, or grandmothers of the boys and girls
who are going. Their eyes are swollen. Their
cheeks are tear-stained. Every now and then
one of them wails aloud, and the others, catching
at the sound, wail with her, their voices
rising and falling in a kind of weird melody
like the ancient plain song of the church.
There are men, too, but they are more silent.
Very often their eyes are wet. Their lips,
tightly pressed, twitch spasmodically. Occasionally
an uncontrollable sob breaks from one
of them. The boys and girls who are to go
are helplessly sorrow stricken. It is no longer
possible for them to weep, for they have wept
too much already. They are drooping despairingly.
At their feet are carpet bags and little
yellow tin trunks, each bearing a great flaring
steamboat label. They wear stiff new clothes,
<span class='pageno' title='312' id='Page_312'></span>
shoddy tweed suits from the shop of the village
draper, dresses and blouses long discussed
with some country dressmaker. These pitiful
braveries mark them out unmistakably from
the men in muddy frieze and the women in
wide crimson petticoats, with shawls over their
heads, who have come to say good-by.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The train comes in. There is a rush to the
carriage doors. Soon the windows of the carriages
are filled with tear-stained faces.
Hands are stretched out, grasped, held tight.
Final kisses are pressed on lips and cheeks.
The guard of the train gives his signal at last.
The engine whistles. A porter, mercifully
brutal, by main force pushes the people back.
The train moves slowly, gathers speed. For a
while the whole crowd moves along the platform
beside the train. Then a long sad cry
rises, swelling to a pitch of actual agony.
Some brave soul somewhere chokes down a sob,
waves his hat and makes pretence to cheer.
Then the scene is over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What happens next in the railway carriages?
For a while there is sobbing or silence. Then
<span class='pageno' title='313' id='Page_313'></span>
wonder and the excitement of change begin to
take the place of grief. Words are whispered,
questions asked. Little stores of money are
taken out and counted over. Steamboat tickets
are examined, unfolded, folded, put in yet
securer places. Already the present is something
more than a dull ache; and the future is
looked to as well as the past.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What happens next to the crowd which was
left behind? In little groups the men and
women go slowly back along the country roads
to the houses left at dawn, go back to take up
the work of every day. Poverty is a merciful
mistress to those whom she holds in bondage.
There are the fields to be dug, the cattle to
be tended, the bread to be made. The steady
succession of things which must be done dulls
the edge of grief. They suffer less who are
obliged to work as well as weep. But the sorrow
remains. He has but a shallow knowledge
of our people who supposes that because they
go about the business of their lives afterward
as they did before there is no lasting reality
in their grief. An Irish mother will say: "I
<span class='pageno' title='314' id='Page_314'></span>
had seven childer, but there's only two of them
left to me now. I buried two and three is in
America." She classes those who have crossed
the sea with those who are dead. Both are
lost to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sometimes those who have gone are indeed
lost utterly. There comes a letter once, and
after a long interval another letter. Then no
more letters nor any news at all. More often
there is some kind of touch kept with the
people at home. Letters come at Christmas
time, often with very welcome gifts of money
in them. There are photographs. Molly,
whom we all knew when she was a bare-footed
child running home from school, whom we
remember as a half-grown girl climbing into
her father's cart on market days, appears almost
a stranger in her picture. Her clothes
are grand beyond our imagining. Her face
has a new look in it. There are few Irish
country houses in which such photographs are
not shown with a mixture of pride and grief.
It is a fine thing that Molly is so grand. It is
a sad thing that Molly is so strange.
<span class='pageno' title='315' id='Page_315'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Sometimes, but not very often, a boy or girl
comes home again, like a frightened child to a
mother. America is too hard for some of us.
These are beaten and return to the old poverty,
preferring it because the ways of Irish poverty
are less strenuous than the ways of American
success. Sometimes, but this is rare too,
a young man or woman returns, not beaten
but satisfied with moderate success. These
bring with them money, the girl a marriage
portion for herself, the man enough to restock
his father's farm, which he looks to inherit in
the future. Sometimes older people come back
to buy land, build houses and settle down. But
these are always afterward strangers in Irish
life. They never recapture the spirit of it.
They have worked in America, thought in
America, breathed in America. America has
marked them as hers and they are ours no
longer though they come back to us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Often we have passing visits from those who
left us. The new easiness of traveling and the
comparative comfort of the journey make
these visits commoner than they were. Our
<span class='pageno' title='316' id='Page_316'></span>
friends come back for two months or three. It
is wonderful to see how quickly they seem to
fall into the old ways. The young man, who
was perhaps an insurance agent in New York,
will fold away his city clothes and turn to with
a loy at cutting turf. The girl, who got out
of the train so fine to look at that her own
father hardly dared to greet her, will be out
next day in the fields making hay with her sisters
and brothers. But there is a restlessness
about these visitors of ours. They want us to
do new things. They find much amiss which
we had not noticed. They are back with us
and glad to be back; but America is calling
them all the time. There is very much that we
cannot give. Soon they will go again, and any
tears shed at the second parting are ours, not
theirs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are many histories of Ireland dealing
sometimes with the whole, sometimes with this
or that part of her story. They are written
with the passion of patriots, with the bitterness
of enemies, with the blind fury of partisans,
with the cold justice of scientific men who
<span class='pageno' title='317' id='Page_317'></span>
stand aloof. None of them are wholly satisfactory
as histories of England are, or histories
of America. No one can write a history
of Ireland which will set forth intelligently
Ireland's place in the world. We wait for the
coming of some larger-minded man who will
write the history, not of Ireland, but of the
Irish. In one respect it is not with us as it is
with other nations. Their stories center in
their homes. Their conquerors go forth, but
return again. Their thinkers live amid the
scenes on which their eyes first opened. Their
contributions to human knowledge are connected
in all men's minds with their own lands.
The statesmen of other nations rule their own
people, build empires on which their own flag
flies. The workmen of other nations, captains
of industry or sweating laborers, make wealth
in their home lands. It has never been so
with us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our historian when he comes and writes of
us may take as the motto of his book Virgil's
comment on the honey-making of the bees.
"Sic vos non vobis." Long ago we spread the
<span class='pageno' title='318' id='Page_318'></span>
gospel of the Cross over the dark places of
Europe. The monasteries of our monks, the
churches of our missionary preachers were
everywhere. But our own land is still the prey
of that acrimonious theological bitterness which
is of all things the most utterly opposed to the
spirit of Christ. So we, but not for ourselves,
made sweetness. Kant is a German. Bergson
is a Frenchman. All the world knows it.
Who knows or cares that John Scotus Erigena
or Bishop Berkeley were Irish? The greatness
of their names has shed no luster over us.
Our captains and soldiers have fought and
won under every flag in Europe and under the
Stars and Stripes of America. Under our
own flag they rarely fought and never won.
Statesmen of our race have been among the
governors of almost every nation under the
sun. Our own land we have never governed
yet. The names of Swift, of Goldsmith, of
Sheridan, of a score of other men of letters add
to the glory of the record of English literature,
not of ours. Our people by their toil of mind
and muscle have made other lands rich in
<span class='pageno' title='319' id='Page_319'></span>
manufacture and commerce. Ireland remains
poor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That is why there is not and cannot be a history
of Ireland. It is never in Ireland that
our history has been made. The threads of our
story are ours, spun at home, but they are
woven into splendid fabrics elsewhere, not in
Ireland. But the history of the Irish people
will be a great work when it is written. There
will be strange chapters in it, and none
stranger than those which tell of our part in
the making of America. It will be a record
of mingled good and evil, but it will always
have in it the elements of high romance. From
the middle of the 18th century, when the tide
of emigration set westward from Ulster,
down to to-day when with slackening force it
flows from Connaught, those who went have
always been the men and women for whom life
at home seemed hopeless. There was no promise
of good for them here. But in spite of the
intolerable sadness of their going, in spite of
the fact that at home they were beaten men,
there was in them some capacity for doing
<span class='pageno' title='320' id='Page_320'></span>
things. We can succeed, it seems, elsewhere
but not here. This is the strange law which
has governed our history. We recognize its
force everywhere for centuries back. America
gives the latest example of its working. An
Irishman returns from a visit to America wondering,
despairing, hoping. The wonder is in
him because he knows those who went and has
seen the manner of their going. Success for
them seemed impossible, yet very often they
have succeeded. The despair is in him because
he knows that it has always been in other lands,
not in their own that our people succeed, and
because there is no power which can alter the
decrees of destiny. But hope survives in him,
flickering, because what our people can do elsewhere
they can certainly do at home if only
we can discover the solution of the malignant
riddle of our failure.</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
